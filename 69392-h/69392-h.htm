<span class="fs80"><em>ADDISON, BRIGHT, AND THE DISEASES WHICH
BEAR THEIR NAMES.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Operative</span> dexterity, as was natural, arrived more
quickly at perfection than did medical treatment.
In fact, no one will pretend that medicine has yet
travelled far, in comparison with its future achievements,
when physiology, pathology, and therapeutics
shall have become more complete. <span class="smcap">Thomas Addison</span>
is a specimen of the physicians of genius who have
adorned this century. He is known as the discoverer
of a disease which bears his name; but his true fame
rests upon his practical talent in diagnosing disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Lonsdale, in his volume of “Worthies of Cumberland,”
issued in 1873, shows that Addison sprang from
the ranks of the yeomanry of Cumberland, and that
his forefathers resided during the Commonwealth at
“The Banks,” in the parish of Lanercost. Thomas
Addison, born in 1636, and Mary his wife, have left
their initials carved on an old oaken settle still preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
at The Banks, inscribed with the injunction,
“When God doth thee in store, remember thou the
poor.” One of his descendants was a Samuel Addison,
who became a doctor of medicine, but died at the age
of thirty-four. Thomas Addison, a nephew of his, was
born in April 1793, at Longbenton, near Newcastle-on-Tyne,
where his father was in business, though he
retained his farm at The Banks, where his wife lived for
the most part. Young Addison clung greatly to the
ancestral home, and many years afterwards assembled
his wedding guests there. It is on the very site where
the Romans encamped during the building of the
wall to the Solway Firth; it overlooks the medieval
Priory of Lanercost; near by is Naworth, the old
Border castle of “Belted Will Howard.”</p>

<p>Thomas Addison was educated at the Newcastle
grammar-school under the Rev. E. Moises, and there
became a masterly Latin scholar, so that he afterwards
took his lecture notes in Latin at Edinburgh. He
went direct from school to Edinburgh University,
declining to enter as a pupil with an Edinburgh doctor,
as his father desired. He was no ordinary student.
Independent in thought and action, he was soon
recognised by the Royal Medical Society, and made
one of its presidents in 1814, an honour which Marshall
Hall, and Richard Bright his subsequent colleague,
also attained about that time. A striking fact it is
that three of the first names of great English physicians
of this century should be Edinburgh students, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Presidents of the same Medical Society there. But as
yet the London medical schools were only in embryo.</p>

<p>Addison took his M.D. degree in 1815, and afterwards,
it is believed, visited the Continental schools;
but of this there is no certain evidence. He soon
settled in London, in Skinner Street, Snow Hill, in one
of the so-called haunted houses. He knew but one
man, an old fellow-student, in London. Yet he received
nearly sixty guineas in his first year of practice, a very
considerable success. He became House Surgeon to the
Lock Hospital; then Physician to the General Dispensary,
where he studied skin diseases with Bateman.
This appointment he held for eight years, and it was of
essential service to him. He manifested a keen eye
for generic distinctions and individual varieties, and
might probably have succeeded to Bateman’s position
in regard to skin diseases. But he was not to be made
into a specialist. As Dr. Lonsdale says, “with Addison
the investigation of any disease meant the full
exercise of his abilities till he had mastered it, and
having done this, he could not rest till he broke up
fresh ground for tillage.” He dreaded becoming a
specialist; it savoured of quackery. He always held
that the true physician must understand surgery well;
and that the good surgeon must know the principles
of medicine.</p>

<p>In 1819 or 1820 commenced Addison’s association
with Guy’s. He early attracted the attention of the
energetic and discerning treasurer, Mr. Harrison, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the beneficent despot of Guy’s, and was by him
appointed Assistant-Physician in 1824. This was a
victory for unconventional procedure, for it had always
been the custom to appoint men at Guy’s who had been
original pupils, and not to receive men who were
already qualified and in practice into the charmed
circle. It was soon evident that a great practical
physician had joined the hospital staff, and he was
further recognised in 1827 by receiving the lectureship
of Materia Medica. Here his attractive powers were
made evident by the large classes he drew around him,
at a period when medical students entered for individual
courses of lectures, and did not as a rule take
the whole of their instruction at one school. He must
have received between £700 and £800 from these
lectures in some years. Men felt that he was the man
to sustain and increase the fame of Guy’s.</p>

<p>In 1829 Dr. Addison published, in conjunction with
John Morgan, Surgeon to Guy’s, an essay on “The Operation
of Poisonous Agents on the Living Body.” Strange
to say, this was the first serious investigation in England
into the phenomena of general poisoning. The
authors believed that a direct influence on the nerve
filaments distributed to the blood-vessels accounts for
the rapid effects of some of them. In 1830, Addison
published a pamphlet on some disorders of females,
vigorously combating some received notions, and objecting
to the system of depletion. In concluding a
lengthy lecture to his class on this subject, he showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the sentiments which animated him by the following
remarks: “Gentlemen, if you require an apology for
detaining you so long, I find ample material for that
apology in the lively interest in which we must all feel
in the comfort and happiness of the other sex, doomed
as they are, both by the decrees of Providence and by
human institutions, to drink deep of the bitter cup of
suffering. Whatever may be her lot in this world, we,
as men, must at least acknowledge that, whilst Infinite
Power gave us being, Infinite Mercy gave us women.”</p>

<p>In 1837 Addison was elected full Physician to the
Hospital, and was appointed joint-lecturer with Dr.
Bright on Medicine. About this time he commenced
with his colleague the “Elements of the Practice of
Medicine,” of which the first volume only appeared,
chiefly written by Addison. It was most highly valued,
but neither author could be induced to complete it.
Valuable monographs in number came from his rich
experience: two on Pneumonia in 1837 and 1843;
Observations on the Anatomy of the Lungs in 1840; the
Pathology of Phthisis, 1845, in which he laid down the
principle that inflammation constitutes the first instrument
of destruction in every form of phthisis. This
early advocacy of a doctrine which has thrown much
light on this disease was strongly opposed by the
physicians of his day, and stamped Addison as a
powerful innovator. He was much impressed by
Laennec’s views, and acquired very great power of
diagnosing from auscultation of the chest. Yet, candid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
ever in confessing ignorance, he read a paper before
Guy’s Physical Society in 1846, “On the Difficulties
and Fallacies attending Physical Diagnosis of Diseases
of the Chest.” Among other subjects, he dealt with
Diseases of the Liver, Affections of the Skin, Disorders
of the Brain connected with Diseased Kidneys, and “the
Influence of Electricity as a Remedy in certain Convulsive
and Spasmodic Diseases,” in every case bringing
together facts hitherto disconnected, and contributing
markedly to advance medicine as a science.</p>

<p>The achievement of Dr. Addison, however, which
has attracted most general notice, is his discovery of a
disease of the supra-renal capsules, the small organs
adjacent to the kidneys, whose function has not yet
been satisfactorily ascertained. We are told that in
one case, which had baffled all investigation, Addison
was called in, and after careful enquiry, stated positively
that the patient suffered from a disease of these
organs, which would before long prove fatal. This
opinion was received with polite incredulity, but it was
justified by the result, and the supra-renal capsules
were the only organs that were found diseased. This
extraordinary diagnosis was soon noised abroad, and on
the Continent brought Addison more honour than in
England. Trousseau in France was cordially supported
in naming it “la Maladie d’Addison” (Addison’s disease),
a name which it will long retain. But the disease was
not discovered in this apparently sudden and striking
manner, but was the result of observations carried on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
for many years, in which his powers of deduction from a
few cases and imperfect data were most strikingly evidenced.
The disease occurs rarely, and very few hints
or materials for comparison were available. A form of
wasting disease without any apparent organic injury had
been again and again observed—bloodlessness, extreme
prostration, and various shades of alteration in the
colour of the skin, being prominent symptoms. A
certain bronzing of the integument was, and still is,
an inexplicable concomitant, and no light was thrown
upon it till Addison, carefully examining the organs of
a deceased patient, when no other disease could be
detected, discovered signs of malady in the supra-renal
capsules. He identified the disease, and though he did
not absolutely mark it out from all others, he gave a
very perfect account of the symptoms in the cases
which he had met with, and showed that no other
disease could be connected with them—indeed no other
disease of these capsules has been discovered.</p>

<p>As a teacher Addison was impressive and popular.
His interest in his class was genuine and unfeigned;
he was eager to draw out the talents of his students.
Among his pupils were Dr. Golding Bird, too early
called from his brilliant career, Sir William Gull,
Dr. Wilks, and many others of note. His clinical
teaching in the wards was especially superior. He
could most vividly illustrate on the patient, and most
clearly define and demonstrate his disease. He disliked
anything like interference with his methods by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
others, and sometimes showed it somewhat brusquely.
Once when he had been away from his wards for a few
days, a colleague had seen reason to change his treatment
of a case of pleurisy. On Addison’s return, he
at once inquired the reason, and was told that the
physician in charge believed the case to be one of
pneumonia and solidification of the lung. “Ah indeed!”
said Addison, “give me a trocar;” and he immediately
plunged the little instrument into the chest, and drew
off a few ounces of fluid, proving the accuracy of his
own diagnosis. He wasted no time in considering or
discussing probabilities; he was certain, and he proved
that he was right.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilks’ view of Addison’s character, in the collected
edition of his works published by the New
Sydenham Society, 1868, is so pertinent that it must
find a place in any adequate account of Addison:—</p>

<p>“His strong, positive, and perpetual insistence upon
the term ‘practical,’ in reference to disease, constitutes,
indeed, the key to Addison’s character and professional
career. He was always ready to discuss newly-started
theories, but he never for a moment allowed them to
interfere with the results of his matured experience.
Possessing unusually vigorous perceptive powers, being
shrewd and sagacious beyond the average of men, the
patient before him was scanned with a penetrating
glance, from which few diseases could escape detection.
He never reasoned from a half-discovered fact, but
would remain at the bedside, with a dogged determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to track out the disease to its very source, for a
period which constantly wearied his class and his
attendant friends. So severely did he tax his mind
with the minutest details bearing upon the exact exposition
of a case, that he has been known to startle
the ‘sister’ of the ward in the middle of the night by
his presence; after going to bed with the case present
to his mind, some point of what he considered important
detail in reference to it occurred to him, and
he could not rest till he had cleared it up. He has
also been known, after seeing a patient within the
radius of eight or ten miles, to have remembered on his
near approach to London, thinking over the case on
his way, that he had omitted some seemingly important
inquiry, and to have posted back some miles for the
purpose of satisfying his mind on the doubt which had
occurred to it. If at last he could lay his finger on the
disease, his victory was attained, and his painstaking
satisfactorily rewarded. For with him accurate diagnosis
was the great, and too often the ultimate object
of an industry of search, a correlation of facts deduced
from scientific observation, and a concentration of
thought rarely combined in the individual physician.
To those who knew him best, his power of searching
into the complex framework of the body, and dragging
the hidden malady to light, appeared unrivalled; but
we fear that the one great object being accomplished,
the same energetic power was not devoted to its alleviation
or cure. Without accusing Addison of a meditated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
neglect of therapeutics, we fancy that we can
trace the dallying with remedies which has been the
characteristic of more recent times. ‘I have worked
out the disease; if it be remediable, nature, with fair
play, will remedy it. I do not clearly see my way to
the direct agency of special medicaments, but I must
prescribe something for the patient, at least, to satisfy
his or her friends,’ seems to have been a part of the
habit of mind which can deal satisfactorily only with
the observable and proven, and shrinks from the uncertain
and questionable.”</p>

<p>Addison did not seek to push himself into notoriety.
Indeed he seems to have studiously kept himself in the
background as regards public life. He took little pains
to seek publication of his researches in the medical
journals, and for the most part his excellent papers
appear in Guy’s Hospital Reports. Thus his practice
was not equal to his great merits, though he died worth
£60,000. In professional intercourse he appeared
blunt, and even at times rude, giving the idea of
hauteur and assumption of superiority. The general
practitioner was liable to find him unapproachable, and
to conceive of him as a man of large self-esteem. Yet
underneath this outward semblance lay a most acute
nervousness of temperament. This powerful, well-built,
energetic, emphatic man concealed a physical nervousness
and susceptibility which most deeply affected
him in circumstances of trial. He often said, “I never
rose to address the Guy’s Junior Physical Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
without feeling nervous;” and yet at the same time
he appeared to his audience to be speaking in a tone
akin even to bluster. His apparent discourtesy was as
far as possible from representing his real sentiments.
“Viewed in its professional aspect,” says Dr. Wilks,
“no character on record has presented in a higher
degree the sterling hard qualities of true professional
honesty. We have never heard a single instance in
which a word of disparagement of a professional
brother escaped him. He would always strenuously,
and with all his natural vigour, maintain what he
believed to be the truth, but never for the purpose of
underrating the opinions of others. His whole bearing
in the profession was to the last degree honourable,
and anything like jealousy or ill-will against another
professional man never entered his mind.”</p>

<p>The chief honour outside his school that fell to
Addison was the Presidency of the Royal Medical and
Chirurgical Society. But court favour did not shine
on him, though none would have more worthily received
it. On the Continent, as we have before said,
Addison was treated with the utmost distinction.
When he visited Paris, Nélaton, Trousseau and the élite
of the profession entertained him at a public dinner, and
gave him the warmest reception. Addison made an
eloquent speech in excellent French. He was a zealous
Tory, not approving of Disraeli’s modernised policy, but
equally removed from Eldon’s tyrannical rule.</p>

<p>Guy’s Museum of Pathology, adorned by an admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
bust of him by Joseph Towne, bears large testimony
to Addison’s energy and discernment. He added
to it very largely, and his early study of skin diseases
led him to suggest and superintend in execution a plan
for illustrating skin diseases by wax models, and carefully
coloured drawings from life—a process afterwards
extended widely through the range of pathology.</p>

<p>“Every feature of Addison’s face,” says Dr. Lonsdale,
“was well defined, and comported well with his finely-proportioned
massive head. He had dark hair, large
eyebrows, and eyes of deep hazel colour; his nose was
pronounced, his lips full and voluble, and rather special
in action, and his chin firm and broad; and his general
physiognomy was stamped with vigour and unmistakable
character throughout. He had a deep penetrating
eye, that became full of life and light when engaged in
debate. Of commanding presence and firm significant
step, he possessed a keen penetrativeness, indeed a
special discernment that never failed him in private
life, and but rarely at the bedside of the sick. He
stood before you the impersonation of power and dignity
and independence.” Some persons who knew him well
believed that he would have had equal success at the
bar, in the senate, in the navy or the Church. Whatever
he attempted, he would have mastered, and would
have carried out, undisturbed by opposition, undeviating
in principle.</p>

<p>Dr. Addison did not marry till he was some years
over fifty. His wife was the widow of W. W. Hanxwell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Esq. The wedding, in September 1847, took
place in Lanercost Church, and was attended by an
unusual incident. Just before the ceremony, and
unknown to the party, a storm had blown part of the
roof of the church on to the altar table. When he saw
the wreckage, Addison exclaimed to his biographer,
nervously clutching his arm, “Good God, Lonsdale!
is this not ominous?” But his friend, suggesting that
any part of the building would do for the ceremony,
and the bride smilingly showing no diminution of
cheerfulness, reassured the doctor, and all went off
well. Mrs. Addison, who had two children by her
first husband, but none by the second, survived Dr.
Addison twelve years. She is described as extremely
amiable, and an excellent wife.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1860 Addison was compelled to
retire from his hospital duties by a threatening of
brain-disease. He settled at Brighton; but his disease
progressed, and ended in his death on 29th June 1860.
He was buried at Lanercost on the 5th of July. A
marble tablet in the chapel of Guy’s Hospital records
that he won the admiration and the confidence of the
students of the Hospital by his profound knowledge
and earnest eloquence: and that he was beloved by the
patients for his unwearied attention and kindness to
them. One of the medical wards in the new buildings
of Guy’s is named after him “Addison Ward.” It is
worthy of note that Addison, like John Bell, was a
musician, and ready at learning a new instrument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Being slightly deaf in one ear, he was correspondingly
acute with the other. This ear he used with surpassing
skill in auscultation of the heart and lungs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the preface to an edition of Dr. Bright’s “Clinical
Memoirs on Abdominal Tumours,” published by the
Sydenham Society in 1861, Dr. Barlow well remarks,
“There has been no English physician—perhaps it
may be said none of any country—since the time
of Harvey, who has effected, not only so great an
advance in the knowledge of particular diseases, but
also so great a revolution in our habits of thought, and
methods of investigating morbid phenomena and tracing
the etiology of disease, as has the late Dr. Richard
Bright. To those who have received the knowledge
of the connections of dropsy, albuminous urine, and
disease of the kidney, among the first rudiments of
medicine, the facts which establish that connection
may appear so simple and easily ascertained, that the
amount of labour, the accuracy of the observation and
the rigid adherence to the inductive method which
characterised the whole of Bright’s researches, may
hardly have been suspected, still less adequately
appreciated.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Bright</span> was born at Bristol in September
1789, his father being a member of the wealthy
banking firm of Ames, Bright, &amp; Cave, and his elder
brother subsequently representing Bristol in three
parliaments. His early education was conducted by Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Estlin, and later by Dr. Carpenter, both names of note in
Bristol. In 1808 he entered at Edinburgh University,
at first attending Dugald Stewart, Playfair, and Leslie,
in whose mathematical class he gained a prize in 1809,
commencing the study of medicine under Monro
tertius, Hope, and Duncan.</p>

<p>In 1810 Dr. Bright, with Dr. (afterwards Sir Henry)
Holland, accompanied Sir George Mackenzie in his
journey through Iceland, and contributed notes on
botany and zoology, as well as other portions, to
“Mackenzie’s Travels in Iceland” (Edinburgh, 1811).
Mackenzie acknowledges Bright’s cheerful and ready
exertion and undeviating good-humour in the many
cross accidents that befel the party. Several times
the two medical friends were in imminent danger, and
we cannot but be thankful that these lights of medicine
were spared to do their <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: life work">life-work</ins>.</p>

<p>Returning from Iceland, Bright’s clinical hospital
work was commenced at Guy’s Hospital, London, where
he lived in the house of a resident officer for two years,
a foretaste of the forty years’ residence which he
practically made within its walls. Astley Cooper
was then in his best form, and young Bright was at
once attracted to pathology and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> observation.
At this early date he made a drawing of a granular
kidney, one of the morbid conditions which he was
afterwards to do so much to elucidate. In 1812-13
Bright was again a student at Edinburgh, where
Gregory was still in full vigour: and he graduated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the 13th September 1813, producing a thesis on Contagious
Erysipelas. With the idea of graduating at
Cambridge, he entered at Peterhouse, where his brother
was a lay-fellow, but he only resided two terms, finding
his studies impeded by college discipline. In 1814
Bright was one of the crowd of English voyagers upon
the Continent, and made himself conversant with
French and German, attending professional lectures
especially at Berlin and Vienna. In the spring of 1815
he travelled considerably in Hungary, and the result of
his observations, for he was emphatically an observer, was
given to the world in his large quarto volume of “Travels
from Vienna through Lower Hungary, with Remarks on
the State of Vienna during the Congress of 1814,” published
at Edinburgh, 1818. This was a most valuable
contribution on the social condition, statistics, and
natural history of that country, then so little known in
England. In all this it is evident how much Dr.
Bright’s career was facilitated by the comfortable circumstances
in which he was placed pecuniarily: not
that money gave him his talent, but that it prevented
him from suffering from the obstacles and disadvantages
which have attended the career of so many physicians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Bright, in the winter of 1814, had been
studying cutaneous diseases under Dr. Bateman at the
Dispensary. On his return home through Belgium, about
a fortnight after Waterloo, he saw many interesting cases
of disease among the sick and wounded from the late
contending armies. In December 1816 he was admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
a Licentiate of the London College of Physicians, and
was soon after elected assistant-physician to the London
Fever Hospital, paying the frequent price of a severe
attack of fever, which almost cost him his life. In the
summer and autumn of 1818 he again visited the Continent,
spending a considerable time in Germany and
Italy, and returning through Switzerland and France.</p>

<p>From 1820 we may date Bright’s full entry upon his
professional career; for he now took a house in Bloomsbury
Square for private practice. His election the
same year to the assistant-physiciancy to Guy’s Hospital
led him to give up the Fever Hospital and concentrate
his attention on the work at Guy’s. He became
speedily noted for his diligent attendance in the wards,
and for tracing the causes of his patients’ symptoms in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> room when they unhappily arrived there.
For many years he spent six hours a day in his beloved
scene of investigation; and long afterwards, when private
practice absorbed more of his time, he longingly
looked back upon the past years of cheerful research and
successful toil. His progress, well prepared for, was now
rapid. In 1821 he was elected F.R.S.; in 1822 he
began to lecture on Botany and Materia Medica; and
in 1824 he lectured on Medicine, in conjunction at
first with Dr. Cholmeley, later taking the whole course
alone. Some years afterwards Dr. Addison became
associated in this lectureship, and the two famous men
for many years upheld and raised the fame of Guy’s
by their copartnership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Bright was not a theorist, was devoid of special
doctrines and “views,” but as Dr. Wilks<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> well puts it,
“he could see, and we are struck with astonishment at
his powers of observation, as he photographed pictures
of disease for the study of posterity.” From this Dr.
Wilks infers that he did not thoroughly perceive the
value of his own work, and that he attached no more
importance to diseases of the kidney than to those of
the liver and brain, which he also described. Dr. Wilks
even regards many observations of Bright as more
novel and original when they were published than
those relating to the kidney, but the latter were of
more value, and their greater significance was at once
recognised. It should be distinctly understood that
Bright was not simply a specialist in kidney disease,
but a clinical physician of rare excellence, who followed
his cases into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> room, and carefully
observed not only the changes which had taken
place in the organ whose disease had caused death, but
also the state of all the other organs of the body.
He was one of the first, if not the first, to describe
acute yellow atrophy of the liver, pigmentation of the
brain in melanæmia (or pigmented blood) due to
miasma, condensation of the lung in whooping-cough,
unilateral convulsion without loss of consciousness in
local brain diseases, the bruit of the heart in chorea, the
small echinococci on the interior of hydatid cysts, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>It is strange indeed that dropsy should have existed
so long and its cause have been undiscovered; and
that renal disease, as we now understand it, should have
been almost unknown. For more than a century before
Bright’s work was published the occurrence of albumen
in the urine of dropsical persons had been known; and
cases had been noted where convulsions and blood-poisoning
had occurred when the kidneys had been
found small and granular after death. Dr. Blackhall
had written a treatise on dropsy in 1813; but though
he found the urine albuminous, he rarely went to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> room and examined the kidneys, which
indeed might often at that time remain untouched.
But until Bright’s first quarto volume of “Reports of
Medical Cases,” 1827, appeared, renal disease had not
been recognised as an important malady; he was at
once hailed as a discoverer, and the malady called after
his name. He first showed how to recognise a common
form of disease, and systematised what was known
about it, and he further demonstrated that there were
three or four varieties of it, a view which subsequent
investigation has most fully confirmed and developed in
most important directions. He proved that not only was
there a continual withdrawal from the blood of most
important albuminous constituents, but that this was
frequently attended with a failure to remove by the
kidneys that natural product of waste, namely urea,
which remaining in the blood in excess became
poisonous, and often produced convulsions and inflammations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
at a distance from the kidneys. This latter
view of the consequences of retained secretion was
not adopted without considerable opposition, but fuller
inquiry only made its truth more evident. And the
adoption of a new truth had its reflex effects in other
departments of investigation. Diseases of other excretory
organs might possibly be caused in the same way;
and so the effects of diseased liver in causing retention
of the bile and its circulation in the tissues became
anew illuminated; and bile-poisoning and blood-poisoning
were placed on a new footing.</p>

<p>Although a large amount of time for many years
was given to the investigation of renal cases, many
other departments of research were the objects of Dr.
Bright’s careful attention. We have already referred
to some of these. Perhaps one series of phenomena
that he was as much interested in as any was the
various tumours of the abdomen, and the means of
diagnosing between them. He published in Guy’s
Hospital Reports an extended set of monographs on
these subjects, which have been published in a collected
form by the New Sydenham Society. They are chiefly
clinical, illustrated by well-grouped cases, observed
and recorded with great care and accuracy, and abounding
in important suggestions as to diagnosis and
function.</p>

<p>The second volume of “Reports of Medical Cases”
appeared, in two parts, in 1831, and contained principally
narrations of cases of cerebral and spinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
diseases, including paralysis, epilepsy, tetanus, hydrophobia,
and hysteria, with observations on their
nature and pathology. The many coloured plates in
both volumes are of great excellence and authority,
being executed under Dr. Bright’s own superintendence.
He was afterwards associated with Dr. Addison in
the production of the first volume of the “Elements
of the Practice of Medicine.” The first volume of
Guy’s Hospital Reports, published in 1836, contains
no fewer than eight papers from Bright’s own pen.
In 1832 Dr. Bright was elected a Fellow of the Royal
College of Physicians, and in 1833 gave the Gulstonian
lectures at the College, on the Functions of the Abdominal
Viscera, with observations on the diagnostic
marks of the diseases to which the viscera are subject.
In 1836 he was censor, and in 1837 gave the Lumleian
lectures on Disorders of the Brain.</p>

<p>In his early years Dr. Bright’s practice was not
very extensive. He was disinclined to use any
adventitious aids to popular reputation, and was
content to pursue his tireless investigations. His
publications on renal disease gradually attracted general
attention, and the profession found him a most reliable
and valuable consultant, so that in his later years
he commanded a first-class practice. A few years
before his death he resigned his post at Guy’s Hospital,
and was made Honorary Consulting Physician. He
died on the 11th December 1858, from the consequences
of extensive and long-standing ossification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
of the aortic valves of the heart, the exit for the
blood being reduced to a mere chink. He had long
suffered very considerably, but was never thoroughly
examined in life. However, he believed considerably
in the value of medicine, and took large
quantities of some kinds. He was buried at Kensal
Green.</p>

<p>Bright is described as having had “a remarkably even
temper and cheerful disposition: he was most considerate
towards the failings of others, but severe in the
discipline of his own mind. He was sincerely religious,
both in doctrine and practice, and of so pure a mind
that he never was heard to utter a sentiment or to
relate an anecdote that was not fit to be heard by the
merest child or the most refined female. He was an
affectionate husband and an excellent father, not only
taking the most lively interest in the welfare of his
children, and in their pursuits, but never so happy as
when he had them around him; so that half the
pleasure of the long vacation was lost, unless he had as
many members of his family as possible for his companions.”
He married, first, the third daughter of Dr.
Babington, senior; and secondly a sister of Sir William
Follett, by whom he left surviving three sons, one
being Dr. Bright of Cannes, and another the Rev. James
Franck Bright, the well-known historian, and Master
of University College, Oxford.</p>

<p>It is said of Bright that he was perhaps better known
abroad than any other British physician of his time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
The confidence reposed in him by his professional
brethren was dependent largely upon the minute
attention he bestowed upon every case. He always
took careful notes, and often made drawings, being a
good draughtsman and rather a connoisseur in etchings
and engravings.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>LISTON, SYME, LIZARS, AND THE NEWER SURGERY.</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Among</span> operating surgeons few names take higher
rank than those of Liston and Syme, at one time
close associates in private medical teaching at Edinburgh,
at a later period jealous rivals and even
antagonists, but happily again warm friends before the
sudden end of the elder. <span class="smcap">Robert Liston</span> was born on
the 28th October 1794, his father being the Rev. Henry
Liston, minister of Ecclesmachan, Linlithgow, whose
accomplishments included a considerable acquaintance
with the theory of music, and who wrote a treatise on
Perfect Intonation in addition to inventing an organ
calculated to produce the desired intonation. He was
educated chiefly by his father up to the age of fourteen,
and afterwards attended classical and mathematical
lectures in Edinburgh University during two sessions,
obtaining a prize for Latin composition in the second.
At this period of his life he exhibited great fondness
for the sea, and was only induced to give up his desire
to become a sailor by a promise that if he would study
medicine he should eventually be a naval surgeon if
he wished. His taste for a seafaring life never forsook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
him; and one of the relaxations which he most enjoyed
up to within a few weeks of his death, was sailing in
a yacht which he kept on the Thames. He was also
very fond of field-sports.</p>

<p>In 1810 Liston commenced medical study as the
pupil of Dr. Barclay, the well-known anatomical
lecturer. He soon became noted by his instructor
for his zeal and untiring assiduity, and he eventually
chose him as his assistant and prosector, an office he
retained until 1815. It was thus that Liston acquired
the foundation of his remarkable knowledge of surgical
anatomy, which his later experience strengthened, and
to which he added a dexterity in the use of surgical
instruments, and especially the knife, which was
unsurpassed in his time.</p>

<p>In 1815 Liston became surgeon’s clerk or house-surgeon
in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in which
capacity he availed himself fully of the opportunities
for making <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> examinations, which were then
performed by the house-surgeons. In 1816 he went to
London, and studied several months at St. George’s
Hospital, and also attended some of Abernethy’s lectures.
In 1817, having taken the diplomas of the College of
Surgeons both in London and Edinburgh, he began
practice in Edinburgh, and again assisted Dr. Barclay in
his anatomical teaching. But misunderstandings arising
between them, Liston left Barclay and commenced to
lecture on his own account at the beginning of the session
1818-19, James Syme becoming his assistant. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
1823 Liston gave up teaching anatomy in favour of
Syme, in order to devote himself entirely to surgical
teaching; but Liston retained a large share of the proceeds
of the anatomical lectures, as the originator and
more important proprietor of the joint school. This
arrangement did not last long, Syme withdrawing to
Brown Square in 1824: and it appears that Liston is, at
least equally with Syme, open to the charge of having
displayed serious jealousy in this matter. They were
unavoidably serious rivals, too nearly equals in power,
and perhaps too conscious of their own individual
claims, to be able to view with equanimity each other’s
proceedings and advancement.</p>

<p>Liston had published a little book on the Surgical
Anatomy of Crural Hernia (1819), and soon acquired
fame by performing several brilliant operations, difficult
amputations, ligatures of arteries, lithotomy, &amp;c. At
that time there were many defects in the management
of the Royal Infirmary, and Liston set to work, young
as he was, to agitate for their removal. Unfortunately
he did not make any attempts to conciliate the
managers in so doing, and his outspoken complaints
were met with bitter opposition from some of the
surgeons as well as managers. He entered into the
spirit of controversy which Dr. Gregory had done so
much to foment, and in which so much of the talent
and time of Edinburgh men was then wasted. In 1821
Liston records that he was almost daily applied to by
patients from the Infirmary who had failed to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
relief from the surgeons, and he was exposed to the
charge of decoying patients thence. It was even
demanded of him, on pain of perpetual exclusion from
the surgeoncy to the Infirmary, that he should refuse his
professional assistance to any person who had been a
patient there. He naturally refused to comply with
any such condition, nor would he absent himself from
attendance on the Infirmary practice, as was also
suggested. It is fair to say that Liston courted the
fullest investigation of his actions, and denied that he
had ever directly or indirectly insinuated to any patient
of the Infirmary that the practice followed there was
bad, or that he himself knew better, or had in any way
tried to entice patients away. But he did complain of
the tedious and often injurious delay which took place
before patients were operated upon, and the unsatisfactory
result of many of the operations; while he
himself had undoubtedly cured many discharged as
incurable, or imperfectly relieved. The young surgeon
showed so vigorous a front that great efforts were made
to make the most of any imprudences he committed,
and to deter students from attending his classes,
especially by hints that they would come off very badly
before the College of Surgeons if they did. Strange
that he who now maintained so bold an attack upon
convention and authority, should have shown such
jealousy of his former demonstrator, Syme, and have
endeavoured by manner, and more than manner, to
repress and depreciate a still younger man’s skill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
This was but one of the many inconsistencies and
difficulties that Liston’s consciousness of his own
powers and his abrupt and somewhat rough manner
of dealing with differences of opinion led him into.
Nevertheless the scathing charges of incompetency
which Liston brought against some of the surgeons
then in office, and supported in detail, were sufficient
to prove to the managers that Liston was no ordinary
young man, but must be allowed a full field for his
talents; and consequently gaining increasing fame as a
lecturer on surgery, and attracting large classes of
students, Liston in 1828 became one of the surgeons
to the Royal Infirmary.</p>

<p>But Liston’s interest was insufficient to gain him the
Professorship of Surgery in the University when it fell
vacant, and he gladly accepted the offer of the Surgeoncy
to the North London Hospital with the Professorship of
Clinical Surgery in University College in 1834. His
transfer to London was a striking success. He had
already published, in 1833, his “Principles of Surgery,”
which went through several editions. Its clearness,
simplicity, and homeliness of style made it popular,
and well calculated to widen his fame. Unornamental
almost to a fault, and perhaps deficient in illustration,
he gave much practical information, and definitely
elucidated his subject. His “Practical Surgery,” published
in 1837, chiefly giving the results of his own
experiences, was still more popular. His brilliant
talents, however, were those of an operator. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
said of him that he possessed every qualification for
success in this department, great physical strength and
activity, coolness, promptitude, energy, and unflinching
courage, a steady hand and a quick eye, a resolution
which rose with the difficulties he encountered, and
rested on a just reliance on his complete knowledge of
anatomy and pathology. Yet the brilliant operator
was not over anxious to exhibit his talents; he was
often considered remarkably cautious. His deliberation
was as marked before undertaking an operation
as was his fearlessness when it was undertaken. His
readiness and resource under the most varied and
difficult combinations of circumstances were surprising.
He excelled in irregular operations in which no well
established mode of procedure could be followed, but
he had to depend on the decision of the moment as to
the particular case. He knew exactly what he meant
to do and how to do it, and this without delay or
hesitation. Thus he won the reputation of being the
most dexterous operator of his day.</p>

<p>In addition to his “Surgery” Liston published
numerous valuable papers on amputation, difficult cases
of aneurism, tracheotomy, lithotomy, and lithotrity.
He left his impress on a very large number of operations,
either devising new methods of meeting old
difficulties, or improving the accepted modes of dealing
with them. He invented an improved shoe for the
treatment of club-foot, and was great at reducing dislocations.
He once succeeded in reducing a dislocated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
hip-joint after the dislocation had continued no less
than two years. He introduced the method of reducing
dislocated phalanges, especially of the thumb, by
passing the ring of a door-key over the part and
hitching it against the projecting end of the bone, so
that extension and pressure could be brought to bear
simultaneously. After dislocation of the thigh backwards,
he several times took advantage of the immediate
powerlessness of the muscles from shock, and reduced
the limb on the spot without the use of pulleys or even
without the aid of an assistant. He invented or
modified splints for broken limbs. His methods of
performing amputations by flaps became very largely
adopted. He had great success in what are known as
plastic operations, such as restoring a nose by taking
a flap from the upper lip. His name is scarcely
more associated with amputations, however, than with
lithotomy and lithotrity, to which he devoted great
attention. Many of his lectures on those subjects
were published in the <cite>Lancet</cite> and were widely read.</p>

<p>Much importance has been assigned to Liston’s personal
strength as constituting a large element in his
operative successes. His hand and arm, it was said,
might have furnished models for a Hercules, and their
power was not unfrequently shown in operations
requiring great muscular exertion. But he was equally
successful in those in which the most delicate manipulation
was demanded. His decision and force of
character were equal to the accurate control over his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
powerful yet adaptable muscles. He would amputate
the thigh single-handed, compress the artery with the
left hand, using no tourniquet, and do all the cutting
and sawing with the right, with only the aid of a
house-surgeon to hold the limb and tie the ligatures on
the arteries. He did not need time for reflection; his
actions were prompted by a kind of intuition akin to
genius; he seemed to comprehend at a glance the
requirements of any particular case. Yet he never
gave up his habit of studying anatomy, spending as
many hours as possible in actual dissection.</p>

<p>One of Liston’s striking exhibitions of decision
and invention occurred during an amputation of the
thigh by Russell, then Professor of Clinical Surgery at
Edinburgh. An artery in the cut bone bled profusely,
and in consequence of its bony surroundings could not
be tied in the ordinary way. Liston with the amputating-knife
at once cut off a chip of wood from the
operating table, formed it into a cone, and drove it
into the bleeding orifice, and in this way immediately
arrested the bleeding.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Liston’s general principles of treatment are also
worthy of note, as he exercised by their means a
considerable influence on the profession. He early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>became alive to the unwisdom of over-treatment, and
tended more and more to trust to natural recuperative
powers. He was thus enabled to dispense with the
multitudinous paraphernalia which surrounded the
operating surgeon, the repeated poulticing, strapping,
bandaging, anointing, which often rendered a stay in
a surgical ward almost intolerable.</p>

<p>On the death of Sir Anthony Carlisle in 1840,
Liston was elected to the Council of the Royal College
of Surgeons, but did not become one of the Examiners
until March 1846. There is little doubt that he
would before long have attained the Presidency of
the College, had not his career been cut short. His
practice became very large, and there is no doubt that
he undertook an amount of work which many men
would have found impossible. Yet he was noted for
his consideration of the poor and necessitous. It was
remarked in the <cite>Times</cite> after his death that “his
nature abhorred everything sordid, and no man ever
was more strongly impressed with the feelings of
an honourable, generous, and independent practitioner.
In whatever rank of life the ‘case’ occurred, if it
was one of difficulty or interest, this master of his
art was ready with the potent spell of his unerring
bistoury, and his reward was in the consciousness of
his own power, and in the noble pride of having been
ministrant to the relief of suffering humanity. His
manner in ordinary society was sometimes complained
of as harsh or abrupt, and he certainly was occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
neglectful of the mere trifling courtesies of life, and
sometimes careless of refinement or punctilio. He was
a man of thought more than of show. He could not
bear triflers, and he did not always avoid showing his
distaste. He was a fervid lover of truth and sincerity,
and sometimes, perhaps, expressed himself too strongly
when he thought there lurked any meanness or deceit
or affectation. But in the proper and trying scene of
the labours of the medical man—in the chamber of
the sick—he was gentle as he was resolute. He never
had a patient who was not anxious to become a friend,
and the voice which was sometimes discordant amid
the petty annoyances of daily life was music to the
sick man’s ear. Into the scene of suffering he never
brought a harsh word or an unkind look, and the hand
which was hard as iron and true as steel in the theatre
of operation was soft as thistle-down to the throbbing
pulse and aching brow. It may also be added, with
perfect truth, that in the exercise of his arduous duties,
among persons of the highest rank and most fastidious
sympathies, his delicacy and forbearance were as remarkable
as the sound sense which regulated all his
professional conduct. His heart was in his business.”</p>

<p>Liston was warm in his friendships though strong in
his dislikes. He did not readily take to strangers.
It is to be noted that he became frankly reconciled to
Syme after their serious divergence. He took the
initiative finally in 1839, and a genial correspondence
took place between them. They met once more in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the autumn of 1847, when Liston visited Edinburgh,
and were often together. Liston dined with Syme at
Millbank the day after his arrival in Edinburgh, and
again the day before he left for London. Before very
long, however, Liston was carried off by aneurism of
the aorta, which must have existed for years, and been
fostered by his great physical exertions, which characterised
his recreation as well as his work. It had
been found impossible to diagnose his ailment with
certainty till some little time before his death, which
came with startling suddenness upon the medical world
and the public generally. He died on December 7,
1847, aged 53, and was buried at Highgate Cemetery.
A body of 400 students and a large number of medical
men attended his funeral. He left a widow and a
family of six children, two of whom were sons. One
of these, however, died very soon after his father. In
the following May Lord Brougham delivered a glowing
eulogy on Liston at the distribution of prizes at
University College. A sum of about £700 was subscribed
for a memorial, which took the form of a
marble statue—placed in the College—and a gold
medal called the Liston Medal, which is awarded
annually for surgery at the same institution.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">James Syme</span>, another of the great Scotch surgeons
of this century, was born in Edinburgh on the 7th
November 1799. His father, a Writer to the Signet,
was of good family, but owing to unsuccessful speculations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
was involved in difficulties, and left nothing
behind him. Young Syme was educated at the High
School of Edinburgh, and soon showed characteristic
patience and perseverance without brilliant parts. A
certain thickness of speech, almost amounting to an
impediment, strengthened the impression of shyness
that he gave. Instead of country sports, he was fond
of botanising, and of making skeletons of small animals.
A similar tendency manifested itself in his attachment
to chemistry and his fondness for making chemical
experiments. Thus he was equipped with a sufficient
bent towards studies connected with medicine to
render it not surprising when he adopted the medical
profession.</p>

<p>From 1815 onward Syme attended the University
of Edinburgh, taking both Arts and Science lectures
at first. Incidentally, in the course of his chemical
pursuits, he made an original discovery of the waterproofing
process, and having first dissolved indiarubber,
was able to construct flexible tubes of it, and to render
various substances waterproof by brushing a thin solution
of it into their interstices. Not to be diverted
from his medical work, Syme declined to take out a
patent, but published his method. Mr. Mackintosh
of Glasgow soon after patented a process, and Syme
gained no advantage from his discovery.</p>

<p>Syme’s early friendship with Liston led him to
enter Barclay’s Extra-Academical classes in the winter
of 1817-18. In the next winter, however, Syme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
followed Liston when he started on his own account,
and assisted him in demonstrating from the beginning.
He perseveringly continued studying, and in
1822 went to Paris to improve himself both in anatomy
and operative surgery, gaining especial advantage from
Lisfranc’s and from <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Dupuytreu's">Dupuytren’s</ins> operations and instructions.</p>

<p>While demonstrating for Liston, Syme was pursuing
his medical studies at the Royal Infirmary and elsewhere,
and became impressed with the unwisdom of
the repeated and severe blood-letting then in vogue.
In 1823, having become a qualified surgeon, and entering
into practice in Edinburgh, Syme performed his
first striking operation—one which he himself designated
as “the greatest and bloodiest in surgery”—namely,
amputation at the hip-joint. Its success was an
earnest of his future triumphs. In the same year
Liston retired from teaching anatomy to devote himself
entirely to surgery, and Syme occupied his place.
The summer of 1824 was spent in studying surgery
as practised in Germany. The same year a coldness
which had been growing between Liston and Syme
caused the withdrawal of the latter from association
with Liston, and his starting a new school in Brown
Square in partnership with Dr. Mackintosh. Here
Syme taught anatomy and surgery, Dr. Mackintosh
medicine and midwifery, and Dr. Fletcher physiology.
The class in surgery numbered as many as fifty students.
But the difficulties and scandals attending the due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
supply of subjects for dissection gradually disgusted
Syme with the anatomical part of his work, and a
quarrel with Dr. Mackintosh finally led to his quitting
the Brown Square school, and devoting himself entirely
to surgery. This was a bold stroke, seeing that he
had four or five formidable competitors in Edinburgh,
including Liston, Lizars, and Fergusson (afterwards
Sir William). Yet so strikingly was he justified by
the event, that in 1828-9 his class increased to 250,
the largest ever assembled by any teacher of pure
surgery in Edinburgh. Practice had been flowing in
upon him, stimulated in 1826 by an important paper
on the treatment of wounds, in which he insisted on
the importance of providing a free outlet for all discharges
instead of almost hermetically sealing them
up, as was so frequently done. In 1827 he gave
another evidence of his remarkable operative skill by
successfully removing a huge tumour involving part
of the lower-jaw bone, an operation which no other
surgeon would undertake. Sixteen years afterwards
the patient was met with, having his deformity well
covered by a vigorous beard.</p>

<p>It was natural that the lack of a hospital appointment
should be keenly felt by Mr. Syme, and that he
should apply for one when a vacancy occurred at the
Royal Infirmary; but his action when this was refused
to him, in view of the rivalry existing between
himself and Liston, was eminently energetic and
commendable. He started a small hospital for twenty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
patients at Minto House on his own responsibility;
but although he fortified himself with an influential
committee and received a certain amount of annual
subscriptions, the principal part of the expense
throughout fell upon himself. Thus in the first year
the public subscribed £217 and Mr. Syme £779,
including £400 which he received in students’ fees.
About this time, too, he married a sister of his old
schoolfellow Robert Willis, afterwards the biographer of
Sydenham, and set up a carriage. These expenses led
him into pecuniary difficulties, which were not easily surmounted
at first, but in a few years his circumstances
became easy through the rapid increase of his practice.</p>

<p>Syme’s clinical lectures became remarkable from the
novelty of the method he employed. It had been
customary in Edinburgh to lecture on a certain number
of cases somewhat resembling each other, without the
patients’ presence or anything to emphasise the instruction.
The young innovator brought the patients one
by one into the lecture-room, questioned them, demonstrated
the principal features of their complaint, and
then explained the principle of his treatment, in the
presence or absence of the patient, according to circumstances,
and finally operated, when necessary, in the
presence of the pupils. Syme was a man of few words
and earnest manner; he illustrated his remarks by few
but well-chosen personal experiences, but gave nothing
superfluous; and it is not to be wondered at that his
success was marked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Liston’s jealousy increased as the success of Minto
House became assured. In 1830 Liston wrote in the
subscription book of his rival’s hospital, “Don’t support
quackery and humbug.” This led Syme to bring an
action for libel against Liston, which the latter had to
settle by apologising. In 1831, however, his exertions
were successful in gaining the professorship of surgery
at the Edinburgh College of Surgeons for his friend
Lizars by a majority of one vote over Syme. In 1832,
when Liston’s practical treatise “The Elements of
Surgery” appeared, Syme also came forward with his
more theoretical “Principles of Surgery.” In 1833
Syme took advantage of a chance which he longed
for, and agreed with the retiring professor of clinical
surgery in the University (Russell) to allow him £300
a year for life if he became his successor. This was
after Liston had refused to come to any such arrangement.
When it was carried into effect in 1833 the
managers of the Infirmary felt that they must allow
the new clinical professor to have wards for clinical
teaching, notwithstanding Liston’s active opposition.</p>

<p>Syme’s success as a teacher followed him to the Infirmary,
and pupils crowded his wards. He was regularly
present when Liston operated, but never took any
part with him. Syme’s appearance often, it is said,
excited the evident scorn of Liston, though no open
hostilities took place. The strained condition of affairs
was alleviated by the removal of Liston to London in
1835. It is satisfactory to find that the quarrel was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
finally healed in 1839, when Liston wrote to Syme,
“Will you allow me to send you a copy of my last
book? Write and tell me that you wish to have our
grievances and sores not plastered up, but firmly cicatrised.”
A genial correspondence followed.</p>

<p>We wish it could be said of Syme that all his disputes
were as happily concluded. His intimate friend
Dr. Belfrage, minister of Slateford, whom he consulted
in all his difficulties, told him “he was always right
in the matter, but often wrong in the manner, of his
quarrels;” and this must be held to account in part
for the number and seriousness of the controversies in
which he became involved, few of which, however,
need be referred to here. It may be questioned whether,
on numerous occasions when Mr. Syme defended himself
against attacks or brought actions for damages, he
would not have done better to content himself with
appealing to his well-known character and attainments,
and living down aspersions. But Gregory and others
in Edinburgh had left an evil habit of controversy in
the air; and though Syme was more moderate than his
predecessors, he often had his hands full. Although he
was himself a great improver of professional practice, he
was really a conservative in his attitude towards other
men and new methods. His opposition to Simpson’s
discovery of anæsthetics, and to his introduction of
acupressure for closing cut blood-vessels without the use
of a ligature, is an example of this. It is to be noted,
however, that Syme’s numerous controversies left no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
detrimental impression on the public, and did not
detract from the warmth of affection which a host of
friends testified towards him.</p>

<p>Liston’s removal to London left Syme practically in
possession of the leading surgical practice in Scotland
at the age of thirty-five. So marked was his progress
that soon after the Queen’s accession he was appointed
Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen for Scotland. A
little later a considerable fortune was left him by an
uncle, and thenceforward he enjoyed an ease of circumstances
which, while it rendered his actions independent,
was not at all detrimental to his professional
success. The good work which, in addition to operative
successes, he was accomplishing may be judged by the
titles of the papers contained in a selection from his
published writings, published in 1848. These “Contributions
to the Pathology and Practice of Surgery”
included, among others, papers on senile gangrene, on
the power of periosteum to form new bone, on ulcers
of the leg, on amputation at the ankle-joint, on the
treatment of popliteal aneurism, on excision of the
ankle-joint, on the contractile or irritable stricture of
the urethra, and on lithotomy. In all these he introduced
new modes of treatment or operation or propounded
new views, and many of his improvements
are generally adopted. In 1847 Liston’s sudden death
led to his chair at University College, London, being
offered to Syme. After anxious weighing of the
question he decided to accept the post. On his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
quitting Edinburgh he was entertained at dinner by
more than a hundred members of the medical profession.
Dr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Christison, who
presided, said no man had ever obtained so early in
life as Syme the position of consulting surgeon for a
whole nation; and this he owed entirely to his intrinsic
merits. He referred to the collateral pursuits with
which many doctors had recreated themselves. Dr.
Cullen had his rural retreat; Dr. Gregory his Latin and
polemics; Sir Charles Bell his pencil and his rod; Mr.
Liston his hunter; Mr. John Bell his trombone. Mr.
Syme had rendered his garden and conservatories conspicuous
in a land of gardeners.</p>

<p>Mr. Syme arrived in London in February 1848,
and settled in Bruton Street. An amusing incident
occurred in connection with his first lecture at University
College. Having been accustomed to give clinical
lectures in the operating theatre at Edinburgh, which
was provided with seats, he supposed a similar arrangement
obtained in London, and announced his intention
of lecturing in the operating theatre without having
previously visited it. On entering the room to deliver
his lecture, he found the students were seated inelegantly
on the rails which rise behind one another in
the amphitheatre. This attitude shocked him at first,
but was soon exchanged for a more befitting one.</p>

<p>Difficulties, however, arose in connection with the
chair of systematic surgery, which he was asked to
undertake with that of clinical surgery. This he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
felt would occupy too much time, and require a devotion
to theoretical surgery and to pathology which did
not accord with his bent. On the 7th of May some
discourteous demonstrations at the College prize distribution
towards two of his colleagues deeply wounded
him; and he wrote “that the slightest approach to
any insult of the kind, whether offered in the comparative
retirement of the lecture-room or inflicted
publicly with the silent sanction of the presiding
authority of the College (Lord Brougham), would
effectually incapacitate him from ever addressing his
pupils with satisfaction to himself or benefit to them.”
In three days afterwards, having declined the fresh
post offered him, he resigned that for which he had
quitted Edinburgh. Fortunately his old position at
Edinburgh had not yet been filled up, and he returned
with alacrity to his familiar theatre and beloved home,
his experiment having cost him £2000. He had been
well received by the heads of the profession in London,
and was rapidly gaining practice. His own brief comment
on the change from Edinburgh to London was,
that ambition made him sacrifice happiness, and that
he found such a spirit of dispeace in University College
as to forbid any reasonable prospect of comfort.</p>

<p>The succeeding years furnish a multitude of records
of honours paid to Professor Syme, and of distinguished
successes in operating. In 1848-9 he was elected
president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh,
and greatly elevated the character of its proceedings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
in 1850-1 he was president of the Edinburgh
College of Surgeons. For years few numbers of the
<cite>Monthly Medical Journal</cite> appeared without a lecture,
case, or observation of importance from him. One of
his most striking operations was the removal of the
entire upper-jaw bone by making one incision in the
cheek, with perfect success; the wound healed without
a drop of matter, and it was difficult subsequently to
trace the line of incision. The patient’s articulation
remained quite distinct. Two of his most difficult
operations in 1857 were connected with the tying of
arteries for cure of aneurisms—one of the carotid, the
other of the iliac, artery. The frightful risks and the
excellent procedure by which they were successfully
encountered still further enhanced Mr. Syme’s great
reputation. In 1856-7 his “Principles of Surgery”
reached a fourth edition. Its terse style and clear
exposition had rendered it a great favourite with practical
surgeons. A striking feature in it is the constant
reference to fundamental principles. It was said of
him at this period, “Mr. Syme is never at fault. Something
unforeseen or unexpected may occur, but its
import is at once understood and the contingency
provided for.”</p>

<p>At the Great Exhibition of 1862 Syme was chosen
chairman of the jury on surgical instruments. In
1863 he visited Dublin once more, and expounded his
principles before the leading surgeons, being received
there as a man of European reputation. His operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
for the relief of axillary and carotid aneurisms, as well
as his bold excision of the whole scapula for tumour,
with safety and without much loss of blood, were continually
increasing his fame. In 1864 he published
his work on the Excision of the Scapula, and proved
that the wound might heal quickly and soundly, and
the arm remain strong and useful. A great operation
for relief of a distressing disease by excision of a
large part of the tongue was wonderfully successful
in November 1864. This was the last case Syme had
time to publish. In August 1865 he gave the address
in surgery at the meeting of the British Medical Association
in Leamington. In it he gave a graphic account
of modern improvements in surgery, in which he had
himself a large share, and contrasted it with the state
of things at the beginning of his professional career.
It constituted a most valuable review of the history of
surgery during the century. Syme was the first representative
at the Medical Council of the Universities of
Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and might not improbably
have been its president but for his illness and death.
His last great controversy was that known at Edinburgh
as the “Battle of the Sites.” A new hospital was
required, and at first, in 1866, Syme was strongly in
favour of a new building on the old site. But further
experience of erysipelas and pyæmia in the old hospital
convinced him of the necessity of having an
entirely new building in which the old disadvantages
would be absent. He consequently changed his view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and strongly advocated the new plan, which was ultimately,
in 1869, accepted. But he did not live to see
the new work begun.</p>

<p>In private life Syme was genial and happy, throwing
off all professional cares, quarrels, and anxieties in the
home circle. His unobtrusive religion was an essential
feature of his character. He was devoted to truth
and earnest in its advocacy, and hence sprang many of
his controversies; but he had no love for controversy
as such. His domestic life was very happy, though
broken at various times by death. His first wife died
in 1846: of her numerous family two daughters only
survived to adult age, one of them being now the wife
of Sir Joseph Lister. His second wife was the sister
of Burn, the architect: this union was equally happy
with the former; but the second Mrs. Syme also died
before him. Her youngest child was Mr. James
Syme, the present proprietor of Millbank. This
house and estate Professor Syme decorated and improved
with all that horticulture and excellent taste
could devise, and it was under his sway one of the
most charming resorts near Edinburgh. His social
gatherings of eight, ten, or twelve choice spirits were
delightful, and his hospitality was both large and discriminating.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to record that Mr. Syme welcomed the
greatest surgical improvement of modern times, that
brought forward by Professor Lister, his son-in-law.
In 1868 he contributed a valuable paper to the <cite>British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Medical Journal</cite> “On the Antiseptic Method of Treatment
in Surgery,” by which he greatly aided its progress.
This was his last year of full practice. In
April 1869 he was seized with paralysis, resigned his
professorship and surgeoncy soon after, but recovered
sufficiently in the autumn to receive a testimonial in St.
James’s Hall, London (November 10, 1869), at a public
dinner in which the leaders of the profession vied with
one another in honouring him. The testimonial took
the form of the endowment of a surgical fellowship in
the University of Edinburgh, in addition to the placing
of a marble bust in the Infirmary or University library.
A bust was subsequently placed in both of these situations.
Syme at length died, after repeated attacks of
paralysis, on the 20th of June 1870.</p>

<p>It has been well said by Professor Goodsir, that few
men come to their principles at such an early age as
Mr. Syme. His terseness of writing aided greatly in
their propagation, and his practice was extended far
and wide by the assurance that “he never wasted a
word, nor a drop of ink, nor a drop of blood.” He was
great too in his conservation of all parts which might
by any dexterity and patience be made useful. His
revival of operations for the excision of joints rather
than the amputation of limbs is an instance of this.
Syme’s operation of amputation at the ankle-joint will
always remain in vogue as the least fatal and most
useful in surgery.</p>

<p>Professor Lister has thus summed up Syme’s character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
as a surgeon—“A practical surgeon, Mr. Syme presented
a remarkable combination of qualities; and we
have not known whether to admire most the soundness
of his pathological knowledge, his skill in diagnosis,
resembling intuition, though in reality the result of
acute and accurate observation and laborious experience,
well stored and methodised; the rapidity and
soundness of his judgment, his fertility in resources
as an operator, combined with simplicity of the means
employed, his skill and celerity of execution, his fearless
courage, or the singleness of purpose with which
all his proceedings were directed to the good of his
patients.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Though his fame has been overshadowed by the
greater distinction of Liston and Syme, John Lizars
deserves mention, not only as a brilliant operator, but
also as a teacher, lecturer, and author. He was fortunate
in his instructor, having been the pupil and
apprentice of John Bell. After obtaining his qualification
in 1808 Lizars became a naval surgeon, and saw
good service on the Spanish and Portuguese coasts in
Lord Exmouth’s fleet. He left the navy in 1815, and
settled in Edinburgh, joining Allan, who lectured on
surgery, and taking himself the departments of anatomy
and surgery. Later, when this partnership was dissolved,
Lizars continued to lecture, adding surgery
before long to his programme, and hence being almost
incessantly engaged during the prolonged winter session<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
with his daily lectures on each subject. His zeal and
method attracted, and retained for years, classes frequently
numbering one hundred and fifty. He was
obliged after a time to limit his labours when the
Edinburgh College of Surgeons decided to recognise
lectures in one department only from any given
lecturer; and he resigned his anatomical lectures to
his brother Alexander, afterwards Professor of Anatomy
in the University of Edinburgh, and thenceforward
lectured on surgery alone. In 1831 John Lizars was
appointed Professor of Surgery to the College of
Surgeons, a post which he held for eight years. He
had previously become surgeon in the Infirmary, and
was considerably senior to Liston. The two were not
unworthy compeers as regarded brilliancy in operating.
Lizars’ ease and coolness under circumstances of
difficulty were remarkable. He is said to have been
the first who performed the operation for the removal
of the lower jaw.</p>

<p>Lizars published a “System of Practical Surgery”;
but is perhaps best known for his great folio series of
coloured “Anatomical Plates” with companion (octavo)
volume of text. The engravings of the plates were
for the most part made from original dissections by
himself. They formed an immense series of illustrations,
occupying 110 folio plates, and some of them,
especially those on the brain and nervous system, can
scarcely be surpassed for artistic excellence. It was
really a magnificent work for its day, and had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
large sale; and as regards a great portion of the contents,
since they show actual facts, they cannot be superseded.
After his retirement from teaching, Lizars devoted
himself to private practice, both surgical and general.
He died at Edinburgh, May 21, 1860.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The writer is indebted for this anecdote to Dr. Paterson’s
“Memorials of the Life of James Syme,” in which a number of incidents
relating to Liston are given, with an interesting parallel between
the careers of the two great surgeons (chapter xii., p. <a href="#Page_210">210-216</a>). It is
much to be regretted that no biography of Robert Liston has yet
been written.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>BAILLIE, HALFORD, CHAMBERS, AND HOLLAND, THE
FASHIONABLE AND COURTLY PHYSICIANS.</em></span></h2>
</div>




<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> cannot more strikingly emphasise the change
which has taken place during the present century
in the views and practice of medical men than by
quoting from Sir Henry Halford’s biographical notice
of Baillie, the nephew of William and John Hunter,
and brother of Joanna Baillie. Here we have Halford
acknowledging a current sentiment against physical
examination of the patient. “He (Baillie) appeared
to lay a great stress upon the information which he
might derive from the external examination of his
patient, and to be much influenced in the formation of
his opinion of the nature of the complaint by this
practice. He had originally adopted this habit from
the peculiar turn of his early studies,—and assuredly
such a method, not indiscriminately but judiciously
employed, as he employed it, is a valuable auxiliary
to the other ordinary means used by a physician, of
obtaining the knowledge of a disease submitted to him.
But it is equally true that, notwithstanding its air of
mechanical precision, such examination is not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
depended upon beyond a certain point. Great disordered
action may prevail in a part without having
yet produced such disorganisation as may be sensibly
felt; and to doubt of the existence of a disease because
it is not discoverable to the touch, is not only unphilosophical,
but must surely, in many instances, lead to
unfounded and erroneous conclusions. One of the
inevitable consequences of such a system is frequent
disappointment in foretelling the issue of the malady,
that most important of all points to the reputation of a
physician, and though such a mode of investigation
might not prove unsuccessful in the skilful hands of
Dr. Baillie, it must be allowed to be an example of
dangerous tendency to those who have not had his
means of acquiring knowledge, nor enjoyed the advantages
of his great experience, nor have learned by the
previous steps of education and good discipline to reason
and judge correctly.” Halford then refers to the quickness
with which a good physician makes up his mind
on the nature of a disease; at that time it was oftener
a guess than a process of reasoning. Baillie was one of
the first to study pathology, and to bring into practice
physical examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Baillie</span> was born on the 27th October 1761,
in the manse of Shotts, Lanarkshire, his father having
been Professor of Divinity in Glasgow University, his
mother, Dorothea, sister of William and John Hunter.
After two sessions at Glasgow, Baillie entered, in 1779,
at Balliol College, Oxford, where he completed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
M.D. in 1789. Residing during vacations with William
Hunter, he became almost like a son to him, and
assisted him much in making his anatomical preparations
and superintending his dissecting-room. On the
death of his uncle in 1783, he and Cruickshank continued
the lectures with great success. Baillie lectured
till 1799. One of his pupils said of him that his style,
though not eloquent, irresistibly commanded attention;
he appeared completely master of his subject, was
exceedingly clear, concise, and condensed, and never
at a loss for an appropriate word. He was always
modest and unostentatious. When left sole heir of
his uncle William, he at once transferred to John
Hunter the family estate of Long Calderwood, to which
he regarded him as entitled.</p>

<p>Baillie’s principal work is pathological. In 1793 he
published “The Morbid Anatomy of some of the most
Important Parts of the Human Body,” and although
pathology is now very different from what it was in
his day, and his classification is not now useful, his
facts, when properly interpreted, are still found excellent.
The work met with very great success, and was
translated into many European languages, besides going
through five English editions in the author’s lifetime.</p>

<p>Baillie gradually got into good practice, being appointed
physician to St. George’s Hospital in 1787,
elected Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1790,
Censor in 1791 and 1796, and Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1789. On the retirement of Dr. Pitcairn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
from practice in 1798, Baillie succeeded to a great part
of it, and his practice was still further benefited by his
marriage with the daughter of Dr. Denman, whose great
obstetric practice enabled him to recommend Baillie
very frequently. He resigned his hospital work in
1799, and from that time had perhaps the leading
practice in London, making ten thousand pounds in
some years. He was consulted about George III.’s
case, and in 1810 was made Physician to the King
and offered a baronetcy, which he declined. In 1814
he was also appointed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician in Ordinary">Physician-in-Ordinary</ins> to the
Princess Charlotte, and attended many members of the
royal family. His manner towards his fellow-practitioners
was as pleasing as his conduct to patients. To
both he would carefully explain, as far as possible, his
views of the nature of the case and the treatment required,
and he was exceedingly successful in tranquillising
the apprehensions of his patients. His modesty
was transparent. He would say to his friends: “I
know better perhaps than another man, from my
knowledge of anatomy, how to discover a disease, but
when I have done so, I do not know better how to cure
it.” From this one is not surprised to learn that he
was not fertile in expedients, but if the simplest means
failed, he was often at a loss what to do next, and was
not apt at varying his prescriptions.</p>

<p>Baillie was not without an irritability of temper, in
which we see some resemblance to John Hunter; but
his heart was at bottom most kindly. He would often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
say after an outbreak, “I have spoken roughly to that
poor man; I must go and see him, be it ever so late;”
“that patient is in better health than I am myself, but
I have been too hard with him, I must make him
amends.” There were many instances of his great
and delicate generosity to his patients. Overwork, to
the extent of devoting sixteen hours a day to practice,
enfeebled his constitution, and before the age of sixty
he was compelled to retire in a large measure from
practice. He died at his seat, Duntisbourne House,
near Cirencester, on the 23d September 1823, leaving
a fortune of £80,000. He bequeathed a considerable
sum to the College of Physicians, with his manuscripts
and other interesting curiosities, such as the gold-headed
cane used by Radcliffe, Mead, and others, whose arms
are engraved on it. He was buried in Duntisbourne
Church, but his memory was commemorated by his
professional friends by a fine bust by Chantrey in
Westminster Abbey. His excellent qualities and his
strong religious principle were well set forth by Sir
Henry Halford in an address to the College of Physicians.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Halford</span> was long a contemporary of
Baillie, but survived him more than twenty years. He
was the second son of Dr. James Vaughan, a successful
physician at Leicester, whose third son became a judge
of the Court of Common Pleas; the fourth son was Dean
of Chester and Warden of Merton College, Oxford; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
fifth, Envoy-extraordinary to the United States; and
the sixth was the father of Dean Vaughan, the well-known
Master of the Temple. The eldest son died in
his twenty-third year. The distinction which Vaughan’s
sons attained shows that his judgment was admirably
exercised in their education. In fact, he spent his
whole professional income in providing for them the
best possible educational aids. Henry, like the others,
was sent from Rugby to Oxford (the youngest only
going to Cambridge); and he records, in eulogising his
father’s treatment of them, that not one of them asked
or received further pecuniary assistance from him after
he had finished his education, and commenced his own
efforts to provide for himself.</p>

<p>Henry Vaughan was born on October 2d, 1766.
Entering at Christchurch, Oxford, he graduated B.A.
in 1788, M.D. 1791. He studied medicine for some
months at Edinburgh, and also practised for a time
with his father at Leicester. About 1792 he came to
London, and having a good opening through his Oxford
friends, had courage enough to borrow £1000 on his
own security in order to establish himself in London
practice. Here his good manners and evident learning
stood him in good stead, and he was elected physician
to the Middlesex Hospital in 1793, becoming a Fellow
of the College of Physicians in 1794. In March 1795
he still further promoted his advancement by his
marriage with the third daughter of Lord St. John,
and rapidly rose into note. With all his talents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
however, it looks like one of fortune’s freaks that
Vaughan should have been appointed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text:Physician Extraordinary">Physician-Extraordinary</ins>
to the King in 1793, at the age of twenty-seven;
and that his practice should have so increased that in 1800
he was compelled to give up his hospital appointment.
But fortune had more favours in store for him. He
inherited a large property on the death of Lady
Denbigh, widow of his mother’s cousin, Sir Charles
Halford; and he consequently changed his name in
1809 by Act of Parliament from Vaughan to Halford.
George III. created him a baronet in the same year.</p>

<p>The King had indeed a strong preference for Sir
Henry Halford, as he now became. He secured Sir
Henry’s promise, before the onset of his last long
derangement, that he would not leave him, and that if
necessary he would call in also Dr. Heberden and Dr.
Baillie. To recite the number of royal personages to
whom Sir Henry was physician would be tedious;
suffice it to mention that he attended, besides George
III., George IV., William IV., and Queen Victoria,
having thus been the physician of four English
sovereigns.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Halford possessed talents of
a high order. He is said to have been inferior to
Baillie in accuracy of diagnosis, but superior in the
cure and alleviation of disease. He had quick perception,
sound judgment, and great knowledge of the
powers of medicines. For many years after Baillie’s
illness and death he was undisputedly at the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
London practice. At the College of Physicians his rule
continued unchecked, if not unquestioned, for more
than twenty years, he having been President from
1820 till his death on the 9th of March 1844. He
was largely instrumental in securing the removal of
the College from Warwick Lane in the city to the
present commodious building in Pall Mall East. His
bust by Chantrey was presented to the College by a
number of Fellows. His portrait by Sir Thomas
Lawrence is at Wistow, Leicestershire, where he was
buried in the parish church.</p>

<p>Halford’s early success was not favourable to his
prosecuting original research nor to his publishing
much that is important. His chief publications
were first given as addresses to meetings of the
College of Physicians. In these he showed skill and
pleasing literary art. He wrote on the Climacteric
Disease, on the Necessity of Caution in the Estimation
of Symptoms in the Last Stages of some Diseases, on
the Tic Douloureux, on Shakespeare’s Test of Insanity
(Hamlet, Act iii. Sc. 4), on the Influence of some of
the Diseases of the Body on the Mind, on Gout, on
Phlegmasia Dolens, on the Treatment of Insanity, and
on the Deaths of some Illustrious Persons of Antiquity—and
again, on the Deaths of some Eminent Persons
of Modern Times. It is to be regretted perhaps that a
man of such accomplishments should have left so
little behind him; but he was of use to his day and
generation; and as to the knowledge he had attained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
it served him only to affix the term “conjectural”
to medicine, when speaking of the confidence Baillie
inspired. At least he did not seem to have hidden
from himself how little the medicine of his days
could lay claim to being completely informed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">William Fredric Chambers</span>, the son of an East
Indian civil servant, whose family belonged to Northumberland,
was born in India in 1786. Brought to
England in 1793 in consequence of his father’s death,
he was educated at Bath, Westminster, and Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1808.
He had hoped for a fellowship, intending to take
orders; but being disappointed, he turned to medicine,
and entered at the Great Windmill Street School,
subsequently spending a year at Edinburgh, and
returning to study at St. George’s Hospital, the Eye
Infirmary at Moorfields, and at Bateman’s celebrated
Dispensary. His diligence, both in practical medical
study and in dissections, attracted the attention of the
St. George’s physicians, and on the resignation of Dr.
Pelham Warren, then one of the leaders of London
practice, he was brought forward and elected physician
to the Hospital in 1816 when only thirty years of age.
His East Indian connection secured him, in 1819,
the post of examining physician to the East India
Company, after being some time <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: assistant physician">assistant-physician</ins>.
Notwithstanding his early prominence, his professional
income rose but slowly, showing that neither ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
nor patronage will avail greatly in competition with
the established favourites. It was 1825 before
Chambers’s practice amounted to £2000; and his
pre-eminence was not marked till the death of Dr.
Maton in 1835, and the great age of Sir Henry Halford
(who died in 1844), left him in indisputed possession of
the leading London practice. From 1836 to about 1851
he received in fees between seven and nine thousand
guineas a year. In 1836 he was consulted by Queen
Adelaide, and in 1837 was made <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician in Ordinary">Physician-in-Ordinary</ins>
to William IV., declining knighthood, though made
Commander of the Guelphic order. He was continued
as Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria,
and his successful career was uninterrupted, except
by rather frequent ill-health. About 1851, owing to
the failure of his health, he retired from practice, and
settled near Lymington, where he died on the 17th
December 1855.</p>

<p>Chambers did not win his success either by writing,
teaching, or discovering. In addition to a tall commanding
figure, and the most agreeable, yet straightforward
manners, he possessed striking decision, and
pursued bold and successful plans of treatment in acute
diseases. He kept himself well acquainted with the
advances of others, and was early distinguished by his
adopting the stethoscope. Like many men of great
eminence, he was at heart exceedingly diffident, and
felt acutely the responsibilities which he undertook.
He was continually in fear of doing something wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
or making a mistake. Thus he undoubtedly was a most
conscientious physician, and it is to be feared that he
gave himself much suffering by the minutely painstaking
system that he adopted. Both at the hospital and in
private practice, he personally recorded the particulars
of every case that he saw, together with all his prescriptions—an
astounding instance of laborious effort.
In this way his private practice furnished sixty-seven
large quarto volumes of notes, which were every day
completely written up, and carefully indexed, so that
he could refer with the utmost ease to any case he had
ever seen. Moreover, he made in very many instances
sketch maps of the diseased organs, side by side with
the description. So persistent was he in this conscientious
toil, that he often continued it far into the
night and even till daylight, resuming work again
before nine o’clock. Ill-health was a necessary consequence,
but his reliability was certain to tell in
practice. He could scarcely depend on a single regular
meal a day, so great was the demand for his services.
He literally rushed through the streets driven post-haste
at ten miles an hour. After a serious illness in 1834,
through having absorbed poisonous matter from a
patient who had died of pleurisy, his right hand was
distorted by the results of abscesses; and it was hence
vulgarly reported that his fingers had become crooked
from the continual habit of taking fees. The regard
he won from others may be evidenced by the fact
that Sir Benjamin Brodie for some weeks visited him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
daily during this illness at Tunbridge Wells, when this
entailed much greater loss of time than now. His
liberality was well known, and this, with his frequent
illnesses, caused him to accumulate no great fortune.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With regard to Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Holland</span>, it is with regret
that we own how comparatively slight are his claims
to a place in the gallery of great medical men. He
was accomplished beyond most men, but one is compelled
to ask, what did he accomplish with his great
opportunities? Whom did he teach? what did he
teach? what did he discover? His travelling excursions
extended over almost the whole globe except
Australia. He was intimate for more than half a century
with many men and women of mark on both Continents.
He knew well the Presidents and statesmen
of the United States; prescribed for six Prime Ministers
of England, as well as for its sovereigns and princes.
But even in regard to information of moment which
he might justifiably have given concerning them, he
has been strikingly reticent in his “Recollections of
Past Life.”</p>

<p>Henry Holland, the son of Peter Holland, a much-respected
medical practitioner, was born at Knutsford
in Cheshire, on October 27, 1788. His maternal grandmother
was a sister of Josiah Wedgwood, the eminent
potter, and grandfather of Charles Darwin. Holland
was also a cousin of Mrs. Gaskell, the author of “Mary
Barton,” and biographer of Charlotte Brontë. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
educated first at Newcastle-on-Tyne under the Rev.
W. Turner, and early showed his predilection for
travel by making long pedestrian excursions in the
neighbourhood. In 1803, he went for a year to Dr.
Estlin’s school, near Bristol, where he succeeded at
once to the position of head boy, left vacant by John
Cam Hobhouse, afterwards Lord Broughton, and where
he also commenced his long friendship with Richard
Bright, who has already been mentioned in this work.
His classical and literary tastes here developed, and
were further fostered by a vacation passed at Dr.
Aikin’s at Stoke Newington, and in the society of
his sister Mrs. Barbauld and his daughter Lucy Aikin.
Still, young Holland leaned towards a commercial
life, and entered a Liverpool merchant’s office, with
the stipulation that he was to spend two sessions at
Glasgow University. These saved him from being
bound to a merchant’s desk; for after his second
session, 1805-6, he sought and obtained release, and
took up medicine. At Glasgow he had become intimate
with William Hamilton (afterwards Sir William),
his discussions with whom had doubtless a considerable
influence on his mental development. Holland’s
literary talent already began to show itself, for he
was selected at the age of eighteen to draw up a
Statistical Report on the Agriculture of Cheshire for
Government, and received for it £200, double the
sum proposed.</p>

<p>In October 1806, Holland entered at the Edinburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Medical School; but he did not confine himself exclusively
to one school, for he spent two succeeding
winters in the Borough Schools of London, Guy’s
and St. Thomas’s, and in private study. Resuming
at Edinburgh, he took his degree in 1811. Travel
had already found him apt; in 1810 he went to Iceland
with Sir George Mackenzie and Richard Bright,
and contributed considerable portions to the narrative
of the expedition. Holland early became associated
with the Whig section of Edinburgh society, but he
saw much of its general aspects, and he knew Walter
Scott, Dugald Stewart, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Erskine,
and many others known to fame. He had already
made the acquaintance of Maria Edgeworth during a
visit to Ireland; and her letters to him would in
themselves fill a volume. Everywhere the bright
pleasing intelligent youth was welcomed. As he
could not yet be admitted by the College of Physicians
owing to his lack of years, he undertook extensive
travels on the Continent, venturing into little-known
regions, and published his “Travels in Portugal, Sicily,
the Ionian Islands, and Greece,” in 1815, a work which
yet further increased his fashionable repute. Mrs.
Piozzi, writing from Bath in 1815, says, “We have
had a fine Dr. Holland here. He has seen and
written about the Ionian Islands, and means now to
practise as a physician—exchanging the Cyclades, say
we wits and wags, for the sick ladies. We made
quite a lion of the man. I was invited to every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
house he visited at for the last three days. So I
got the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">queue du lion</i>, despairing of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cœur</i>.”</p>

<p>Holland had spent much time in the military
hospitals in Portugal during his travels, and gained
valuable experience. In Turkey he came into contact
with Ali Pasha, through whom he was deprived of
most of his papers relating to Albania, a mortifying
loss at the time. After his return home he speedily
formed friendships with Lords Lansdowne, Aberdeen,
and Holland, which continued uninterrupted save by
death, and of course led to his intimacy with many
other persons of note, traits in whose characters are
recorded in the “Recollections.” We cannot here
follow the incidents of the brilliant social life into
which Henry Holland entered with so much zest.
Suffice it to mention that he was elected to the Royal
Society in 1816, and admitted on the same day as
Lord Byron, who on that occasion made his only visit.
Henry Holland was an almost constant guest at Holland
House. In the summer of 1814 he became domestic
medical attendant on the Princess (afterwards Queen)
Caroline, to accompany her during her first year of
travel on the Continent. This situation became one of
extreme delicacy, and its importance was very manifest
at her trial years afterwards, where Dr. Holland’s
evidence, declaring that he had never seen anything
improper or derogatory in her behaviour to Bergami
or any other person, proved of extreme weight in her
behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>A man of such connections could not fail to gain
almost as much practice as he liked. His visits to Spa
for four successive years, after the London season,
strengthened his professional prospects, and his fourth
year’s practice brought him over £1200. In a few
years he was able to resolve that his professional
income should never exceed £5000, and that he would
give to study, recreation, or travel all his surplus time.
Thus happily placed, Henry Holland became the friend
of every man of note, the patron of science at the
Royal Institution, of which he was long president—but
not the hospital physician, the clinical teacher, the
original writer, the promoter of medical reform, or the
habitué of the medical societies. He dined out, and
never reproved his patients for the lapses from physiological
prudence which he observed at the table. The
“frequent half hour of genial conversation” was what
he bestowed and was most capable of bestowing on his
patients. Perhaps he thereby solaced their days of
tedium or hypochondria as well as others who might
have sought to root up their habits or impart tone to
their minds with more ruthless energy. “When Lady
Palmerston was suffering from an illness that occasioned
some alarm to her friends,” said the <cite>Times</cite>, in its
obituary notice of Holland, “one of them, meeting the
late Dr. Fergusson, asked anxiously how she was. ‘I
can’t give you a better notion of her recovery,’ was the
reply, ‘than by telling you that I have just received
my last fee, and that she is now left entirely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Holland.’” On this being repeated to Lord Palmerston
his lordship mused a little, and then said, “Ah! I see
what he means. When you trust yourself to Holland,
you should have a superfluous stock of health for him
to work upon.” Holland himself had this superfluous
stock of health. When over eighty he writes: “A
frequent source of amusement to myself is my incapacity
for walking slowly; and the sort of compulsion I
even now feel to pass those immediately before me in
the street, and to take the diagonal instead of the two
sides of a square, whenever this is the alternative.
When I cease to take the diagonal (often a dirty one)
instead of the side pavements, I shall consider that
I have gone a step downwards in the path of life.”
His excursions were almost all taken alone; but he
evidently seldom put himself out of the reach of
general society, as good as the neighbourhood afforded.
He was no recluse, yet apparently not a man of a few
warm strong personal friendships. If he was we find
no record of it. From his utter reticence about his
medical contemporaries, we should judge that he did
not at bottom appreciate them as they deserved.</p>

<p>To give briefly a few of the more notable dates in
Holland’s life, he married first, in 1822, a Miss Caldwell,
who died in 1830, leaving two sons, the present
Sir Henry Holland and the Rev. F. J. Holland; and
secondly, in 1834, Saba, daughter of Sydney Smith.
He was made <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician Extraordinary">Physician-Extraordinary</ins> to the Queen in
1837; <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician in Ordinary to the Prince Consort">Physician-in-Ordinary to the Prince-Consort</ins> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
1840; was offered, but declined, a baronetcy by Lord
Melbourne in 1841; was made <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician in Ordinary">Physician-in-Ordinary</ins> to
the Queen in 1852, and accepted a baronetcy in 1853.
In later years he withdrew altogether from practice,
but continued active in society and persevering in
travel. In his last journey, to Russia, he was accompanied
by his son, the Rev. F. J. Holland; on his way
back he attended the trial of Marshal Bazaine at
Versailles on the 24th October 1873, dined the same
day at the British Embassy, returned to London the
next day, did not go out on Sunday the 26th, and
died quietly in bed on the 27th, on the 85th anniversary
of his birth.</p>

<p>To this extraordinary age lived the man who had
been seen in all climates, in the Arctic Circle or in the
Tropics, on the Prairies or the Pyramids, in the same
black dress coat in which he almost ran from house to
house at home. Sydney Smith said of him that he
started off for two months at a time with a box of pills
in one pocket and a clean shirt in the other—occasionally
forgetting the shirt. Let Sir Henry tell his own
tale of his enjoyment. “The Danube I have followed,
with scarcely an interruption, from its assumed sources
at Donau-Eschingen to the Black Sea—the Rhine,
now become so familiar to common travel, from the
infant stream in the Alps. The St. Lawrence I have
pursued uninterruptedly for nearly two thousand miles
of its lake and river course. The waters of the Upper
Mississippi I have recently navigated for some hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
miles below the falls of St. Anthony. The Ohio,
Susquehanna, Potomac, and Connecticut rivers I have
followed far towards their sources; and the Ottawa,
grand in its scenery of waterfalls, lakes, forests, and
mountain gorges, for three hundred miles above
Montreal. There has been pleasure to me also in
touching upon some single point of a river, and watching
the flow of waters which come from unknown
springs or find their issue in some remote ocean or sea.
I have felt this on the Nile at its time of highest inundation,
in crossing the Volga when scarcely wider than
the Thames at Oxford, and still more when near the
sources of the streams that feed the Euphrates, south
of Trebizond.” Altogether Sir Henry estimated that he
had spent twelve years of his life in foreign travel.</p>

<p>Literary work was a pastime with Holland, and both
in the Quarterly and the Edinburgh Reviews he delighted
to show his extensive reading, and his enlightened
yet very unrevolutionary views. His more interesting
reviews have been published as “Scientific Essays,”
and “Chapters on Mental Physiology;” while his
“Medical Notes and Reflections” constitutes almost all
his practical contribution to medical science. Interesting
“Fragmentary Papers” were published posthumously.
In the “Medical Notes” certain current
questions were philosophically discussed in a most
pleasing style, and some questions of practice treated
with some originality if not with boldness. Two
chapters may be especially alluded to as valuable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
namely, those “On the Abuse of Purgative Medicines,”
and “On Bleeding in Affections of the Brain.” Many
of his chapters on Mental Physiology show wide observation
and kindly insight into the relations of mind
and body. But after all it is by his “Recollections
of Past Life” that Holland will be most known, his
sketches of the leading personages, politicians, wits, and
scientific and literary men having a charming vividness
and truthfulness about them, making every one regret
that so many limitations were imposed by the author

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR WILLIAM FERGUSSON AND CONSERVATIVE
SURGERY.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> association of the word “conservative” with
operative surgery, so strongly identified in the
popular mind with the removal of portions of the body,
needs some explanation to the non-professional reader.
In former times inflammation with denudation of bone
was commonly believed to necessitate amputation;
and diseased joints, especially the elbow, knee and
ankle, with ulceration of cartilages, were generally considered
incurable, except by removal of the limb. As
Fergusson said, the ways of surgery get grooved; they
are hallowed in the estimation of some. The man who
steps from the groove is held to be rash and is called
to account. How much this was the case will be seen
by the reception accorded to conservative surgery,
which aspired to do away with many of the radical
proceedings of the past.</p>

<p>The term “conservative surgery,” as first used by
Sir W. Fergusson in 1852, meant operations for the
preservation of some part of the body, which would
otherwise have been unnecessarily sacrificed. A smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and more limited operation was undertaken to remove
simply the incurably disorganised portion of the body,
such as a diseased joint, and not an entire limb. Thus
Fergusson said, “a compromise may be made, whereby
the original constitution and frame, as from the Maker’s
hand, may be kept as nearly as possible in its normal
state of integrity.” “No one can more thoroughly
appreciate a well-performed amputation than I do,
but I certainly appreciate more highly the operation
which sets aside the necessity for that mutilation.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two great surgeons thus bear testimony to Fergusson:
“The improvements which he introduced in lithotrity
and in the cure of cleft-palate may almost be considered
typical,” says Sir Spencer Wells,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “of the school of
modern conservative surgery, and will long be acknowledged
as triumphs of British surgery in the reign of
Victoria.” He was, in the words of Sir James Paget,
“the greatest master of the art, the greatest practical
surgeon of our time.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Fergusson</span> was born on March 20th, 1808,
at Prestonpans, East Lothian, and was educated first
at Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire and afterwards at the
High School of Edinburgh. At fifteen he entered a
lawyer’s office, by his own desire, but soon found that
law did not suit him, and at seventeen exchanged law
for medicine, which profession his father had wished
him to adopt. He was early attracted by the teaching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>of Robert Knox, the celebrated anatomist, who quickly
discerned the stuff his pupil was made of. Fergusson
would often spend from twelve to sixteen hours a day
in the dissecting-room. One of his dissections of the
nerves of the face, preserved in the museum of the
Edinburgh College of Surgeons, remains an admirable
example of manipulative skill and dexterity, and the
stand on which it is placed is also a specimen of his
work. At twenty Knox made him demonstrator to his
class, which then numbered four hundred. He had
previously assisted John Turner, Professor of Surgery
at the College of Surgeons. At the early age of twenty-one
Fergusson became Fellow of the College of Surgeons
by examination. Knox then promoted him to a share
in his lectures on general anatomy, and the young
lecturer also gave demonstrations on surgical anatomy,
which proved highly valuable. He soon began to
manifest his skill in operative surgery, and in 1831 he
was elected surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Dispensary,
and showed his boldness by performing the important
operation of tying the subclavian artery, which as yet
had only been twice done in Scotland. In 1833 he
married Miss Ranken, heiress of the estate of Spittlehaugh
in Peeblesshire. This marriage, while it placed
him beyond pecuniary difficulty, had no effect in
diminishing his industry. In 1839 he became surgeon
to the Royal Infirmary, and Fellow of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and already shared the highest
surgical practice with Syme. In fact there was hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
room for two such men in Edinburgh. Liston had
betaken himself to London. In 1840 Fergusson followed
his example, accepting an invitation to King’s College,
which was now establishing its hospital. At a farewell
presentation, Lizars said that he had seen no one, not
even Liston himself, surpass Fergusson in the most trying
and critical operations. The man of whom this could
be said at the age of thirty-two had every chance of
success in London, even though he came thither with
scarcely any personal friends to back him. Professor
Partridge, his old friend, gave him a cordial introduction,
and he established himself in Dover Street, Piccadilly,
only to find that his first year’s private practice did not
exceed £100. Yet it cannot be denied that Fergusson
came to London at a fortunate period. Within a few
years death or retirement withdrew from practice many
of the most capable operators, such as Liston, Aston
Key, and Astley Cooper. Thus his success was really
rapid, for his third year brought him £1000, and in
1847 he removed to a large house in George Street,
Hanover Square. His style of operating soon attracted
general attention both among students and practitioners,
and King’s College operating theatre became the resort
of all the medical students and practitioners who could
cram into it.</p>

<p>As an operator Fergusson was most peculiarly skilled,
and he appears to have had a natural manipulative
dexterity, which he assiduously cultivated. Like Sir
Charles Bell and other eminent surgeons, he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
splendid fly-fisher; and his manipulation served him
in good stead in acquiring skill on that most difficult
of instruments, the violin. Carpentering and
metal-working came easily to him, and gave him great
readiness in improvising splints or other apparatus
desirable for his patients’ special circumstances. Yet
having such power and dexterity, he did not choose
to display it on all possible occasions, but rather was
conspicuous for his frequent abstinence from operative
interference, counting it a greater glory to save a limb
than to cut one off, and taking endless trouble to
preserve a portion when amputation would have been
much easier.</p>

<p>Although the rivalry between Fergusson and Syme
frequently led to open dissensions, yet no man more
freely, fully, and repeatedly acknowledged Syme’s great
services than Fergusson. Thus he always ascribed the
chief merit of the revival of the “conservative” operation
of excision of the elbow-joint to Syme. Originally
suggested by Park, and first performed by Moreau, it
was not until the operation was taken up by Syme
that it attracted serious attention. Fergusson followed
in his wake, and extended the same principles till
there was scarcely a part which could be conserved
which he had not laid hands on with that object. To
take an instance from parts of small size. A gentleman
of active habits, in charge of a large establishment,
to whom the use of a pen was of vast importance,
had a bad whitlow at the end of his right thumb. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
abscess was opened in due time, and the bone was
found bare. Amputation was urged, but the patient
objected, and on consulting Fergusson, he was advised
to wait, and then a few weeks afterwards the portion
of bone that died was removed through the original
opening for the abscess. Before long, the thumb,
apparently entire, was as useful as ever. “Opinions
may differ,” says Fergusson, “but for my own part,
I deem it a grand thing when by prescience even the
tip of a thumb can be saved.”</p>

<p>To Liston’s boldness and rapidity Fergusson added
greater caution and self-control. In lithotomy both
were equally distinguished, and attained their end
with the simplest instruments. An anecdote recorded
in the <cite>Medical Times and Gazette</cite> (Feb. 17, 1877)
illustrates this. Some practitioners were discussing
the relative merits of some leading hospital surgeons,
and introduced the subject of lithotomy. “I saw
Mr. —— perform lithotomy to-day in half a minute.”
“Oh,” replied B, “I saw —— once extract the stone in
twenty seconds.” “Have you ever seen Fergusson
perform lithotomy?” “No.” “Well then, go; and,
look out sharp, for if you only even wink, you’ll miss
the operation altogether.”</p>

<p>In 1845 Fergusson revived the plan of excising the
head of the femur for incurable disease of the hip-joint,
and it became established as a valuable operation,
in spite of Syme’s violent opposition. In 1847 Mr.
Fergusson excised the entire scapula, where the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
arm would otherwise have been sacrificed. In 1850
his attention became concentrated on diseases of the
knee-joint, and before long he excised the joint for
severe disease. Although the result was unfavourable,
Fergusson, undismayed, repeated the operation successfully,
and in spite of strong criticism and opposition,
continued for at least fifteen years, it has become
established. The strength of the feeling aroused on
this subject was so great that once when Fergusson
was about to excise a knee-joint at King’s College
Hospital, a surgeon, once a colleague, publicly protested
against the performance of the operation. Fergusson’s
earlier cases were not always well selected
for the operation, and he had many disheartening
failures. But he persevered and improved in his
selection of cases, and achieved what he regarded as
the greatest triumph of conservative surgery.</p>

<p>Some of Fergusson’s greatest triumphs were in connection
with hare-lip and cleft-palate. His first formal
operation in surgery was for hare-lip in 1828. Up to
1864 he had operated on nearly four hundred cases
with only three deaths. The adoption in 1850 of a
spring or truss to push the sides of the lips forwards,
invented by Jem Hainsby (the old dissecting-room
attendant at Guy’s), and the father of a child-patient,
was of great value in preserving the mobile parts of
children from undesirable movements. In regard to
cleft-palate Fergusson’s labours were of even greater
value, for he discovered by careful dissection the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
why the edges of the wound were so often prevented
from uniting, and by dividing the muscles concerned,
in addition to other valuable improvements in practice,
he enabled many patients to gain an excellent undivided
palate. Up to 1864 he had operated on 134 cases,
of which 129 were successful, and only two failed
entirely. It is unnecessary to go through the long
list of successes won by Fergusson; but it is well to
mention that when he found the existing instruments
unsuitable for his purpose, he never rested till he
had invented better ones. The bull-dog forceps, the
mouth-gag for operations on the palate, various bent
knives, and many other instruments and apparatus
bear the stamp of his inventive skill.</p>

<p>With all his operative brilliancy, that did not constitute
Fergusson’s chief claim to admiration, nor was
it the principal cause of his success. The perfect
planning of the operation beforehand from beginning
to end, down to the smallest detail, and being ready
for every possible emergency with the precise method
for meeting it, distinguished him most. Consequently
he neither hurried, wearied, nor hesitated when he
began. Things were so perfectly planned, his assistants
so well drilled, that not a word needed to be spoken,
and this produced a curious appearance at times, so
that it was often remarked that he must be on bad
terms with his assistants. He left no detail unsupervised,
and completed the operation entirely himself, even
applying bandages and plasters. His coolness under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
difficulty was probably connected with his forethought;
he could often cover his own or others’ mistakes in the
coolest manner, and this put him in the best position
for remedying them. It was his pride never to be late.
He hated unnecessary waste of time, and once when a
friend intending to tie a large artery had laid it bare
by a fine dissection, and was showing it with natural
gratification, Fergusson called him to the point by
remarking, “Jist put a thread round it.” So when
a large artery had been wounded, and an assistant
eagerly tried to stop the bleeding with his finger,
Fergusson said: “Jist get your finger out of the way,
mon, and let’s see what it is,” and satisfactorily tied
the vessel.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He was remarkably neat too in his completion
of an operation, and could not bear to leave
any traces behind, either in hospital or private house.</p>

<p>In the subjects which he had thoroughly studied
and on which he had practical experience Fergusson
was a master. This is seen in his “Practical Surgery,”
which reached a fifth edition in 1870, and in his
lectures on the Progress of Anatomy and Surgery
delivered at the College of Surgeons in 1864 and 1865.
But as a systematic lecturer he did not achieve great
success, nor was he conspicuous as a bedside teacher
owing to his reticent manner. It was in operating
that he shone most, and in his remarks on operations;
to see him operate was for the student or practitioner
already instructed what to observe a lesson full of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>practical value. On some important questions he was
imperfectly informed, and this was proved when he
opposed the movement for securing a pure water supply
to large towns, and favoured the anti-vivisectionists
in some remarks and evidence which showed considerable
ignorance of physiological discovery and progress.
Again, his attitude towards homœopathic practitioners
largely compromised his influence at one time.</p>

<p>Fergusson’s social instincts as well as his personal
sympathies won him favour from all classes, and his
male as well as his female patients felt deeply his
kindly attentions, while children simply worshipped
him. His practice was always to treat a hospital
patient with exactly the same consideration as one
in private. Mr. Henry Smith records the profound
impression made upon him as a young student by
his remarkable kindness and gentleness towards a
little lame boy. It is not to be wondered at that
he inspired his patients with the utmost confidence,
an art that many equally clever have lacked. A gentleman
who came to London to have an enormous tumour
of the lower jaw removed, saw several eminent surgeons,
but chose Fergusson as the operator without hesitation.
“Directly he put his hands upon me,” said this gentleman,
“to examine my jaw, I felt that he was the
man who should do the operation for me; the contrast
between his examination and that of others was so
great.” As Mr. Henry Smith says, “Fergusson not
only shone pre-eminently as an operator, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
possessed a profound knowledge of his art, and wielded
all its resources with consummate skill. His powers
of observation were remarkable; his memory was most
tenacious; his shrewdness, sound common-sense, tact and
knowledge of men, and how to deal with them, were
acknowledged by all; and conspicuous amongst them
was that facility of resource in all trying emergencies,
which, added to his extraordinary mechanical skill,
made him what he was, and brought about a success
which has seldom been vouchsafed to any surgeon.”</p>

<p>Fergusson became M.R.C.S., Eng., in 1840, and Fellow
in 1844. He was appointed Surgeon to the Prince-Consort
in 1849, and Surgeon-Extraordinary to the
Queen in 1855, and Sergeant-Surgeon in 1867. In
1861 and again in 1868 he was elected to the Council
of the College of Surgeons, notwithstanding the strong
opposition of the existing council on the first occasion.
In 1867 he became an examiner in surgery, and in
1870 President of the College. His lectures as Professor
have already been mentioned. We may add that
he was President of the Pathological Society in 1859 and
’60, and of the British Medical Association at its brilliant
London meeting in 1873. His many other appointments
and distinctions must be passed over, with the
exception of the baronetcy, which he received in 1866.</p>

<p>Fergusson never tired of work. His fine energies
kept him ever fresh. He could sing, or dance a Highland
reel, with energy long after middle age, and when
just returned from a prolonged and tiring journey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
He was a munificent patron of literature and the drama;
attended many an author without fee, and would not
unfrequently pay for their lodging near him in cases
where that was desirable. His spirit of hospitality
was lavish, whether in London or at his seat at Spittlehaugh
in Peeblesshire. He was ever ready to show
kindly feeling towards even those who censured him
most severely, and his forgiving nature was many
times most conspicuously evident. Whenever he had
any consciousness of having done or said anything
calculated to wound another’s feelings, old or young,
he never rested until he had made reparation in some
way. He held a truly modest estimate of himself,
was unspoiled by popularity, and never became at
all overbearing. He was a staunch friend, to old
pupils especially, and a liberal helper of members of
the profession generally. Many a surgeon who has
risen has owed to him essential help. Indeed, he displayed
the best Christian characteristics, and was, in
Mr. Henry Smith’s words, “the true type of a Christian
gentleman.” He died in London, after an exhausting
illness, of Bright’s disease, on February 10th, 1877, and
was buried at West Linton, Peeblesshire, where his wife
had already, in 1860, been buried. A portrait of him by
Lehmann was presented by subscription to the London
College of Surgeons in 1874, and a replica is in the Edinburgh
College of Surgeons. His best monument is in
the life and work of the multitude of his pupils, whom
he influenced and stimulated as few have ever done.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR JAMES SIMPSON AND ANÆSTHETICS.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Future</span> ages will perceive in the history of medicine
and surgery in the nineteenth century no more
remarkable event than the discovery and the introduction
of means for relieving and temporarily
abolishing pain. And although the name of Simpson
is by no means the only one honourably associated
with this discovery, his achievement in the introduction
of chloroform places him on an enviable pinnacle of
greatness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Young Simpson</span>, the seventh son and eighth
child of a small baker, was born at Bathgate,
Linlithgowshire, on the 7th of June 1811. His birth
took place when his father’s circumstances were at
the lowest ebb. Several of the family, including his
mother, had but just recovered from fever. The
mother had to rise from her maternal pain to take an
active part in business, which she did most energetically
and successfully. Her religious character and her
thrifty habits deeply impressed the little boy, and he
pleasingly recalled in after years her injunction, when
she had just darned a big hole in his stocking, “My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Jamie, when your mother’s away, you will mind that
she was a grand darner.” She died when James was
but nine years old, leaving him in the care of his only
sister Mary, eleven years older, who proved a tender
foster mother. Already as a child James Simpson
became known as “the wise wean,” “the young
philosopher,” and his voice was sweet and silvery.
His industry and retentiveness of memory early gave
promise of distinction, which all the family were
persuaded would fall to his lot. And he would
readily, book in hand, keep the shop for a time, or run
with rolls to the laird’s house. “I remember,” says
his brother Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “finding him sitting in the
street on a very dusty day, sobbing bitterly, the tears
running down his cheeks covered with dust. ‘What
ails you, Jamie?’ I said, and he answered, sobbing
as if his heart would break, ‘I’ve broken the pony’s
knees.’” It turned out that Alexander himself had
overridden the pony, so that it could not help
stumbling.</p>

<p>The father of the family trusted his children in a
peculiar way. All were regarded as equally concerned
in the family prosperity, and the shop till was
unfastened, and free to all; each habitually thought of
the general good first. In this way the household
prospered ever after James’s birth, and he personally
received unremitting attention.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen James Simpson entered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>Edinburgh University, “a very very young and very
solitary, very poor and almost friendless student,” as
he himself said forty years after. For two years he
pursued classical and mathematical studies, gaining a
small bursary before his second session. One of his
earliest purchases was a little book on “The Economy
of Human Life,” for which he gave ninepence. An
extract from it which he wrote in his cash-book is
significant of his temper of mind: “Let not thy
recreations be expensive, lest the pain of purchasing
them exceed the pleasure thou hast in their enjoyment.”
Though an economical student, however, his literary
tastes were wide, as he early bought Byron’s Giaour
and Childe Harold, and Paley’s Natural Theology.
He lodged with Dr. Macarthur, a former usher in the
Bathgate School, together with John Reid, an old
schoolfellow, afterwards Professor of Anatomy at St.
Andrews, in the upper flat of a tall house in Adam
Street. Reid’s enthusiasm for anatomy seem to have
first inspired Simpson to choose medicine as a
profession.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1827 James Simpson entered as
a medical student in the University, and, attending
Liston’s class on surgery, soon became conspicuous.
He took full notes of lectures, and was freely critical
of his teachers. He became a dresser under Liston,
and received excellent testimonials from him. But
he shrank from surgery, having an exquisite tenderness
of heart which almost drove him from the profession.
After witnessing on one occasion a poor woman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
agony under amputation of the breast, he started off
directly to seek employment as a writer’s (or lawyer’s)
clerk. He soon returned, however, deeply imbued
with the desire to do something to render operations
less painful. Simpson’s summer vacations were passed
at Bathgate, natural history and antiquarian pursuits
occupying his spare time. In January 1830, just
before he was going up for his license to practise,
his father died after some weeks’ illness, during which
James constantly watched at his bedside. Such an
interruption to study at a critical moment might have
upset so sensitive a mind. But Simpson went in for
his examination in April, and became a member of
the Edinburgh College of Surgeons before he was
nineteen years of age. His brother Alexander, who,
with the rest of the family, furnished faithful and
persevering help to the young brother of whom so
much was expected, gave him a home while he looked
out for some post to occupy him while waiting for
his Edinburgh degree, which his youth prevented him
from taking as yet. One of the situations which he
sought was that of parish surgeon in a little village
named Inverkip, on the Clyde. “When not selected,”
he writes long after, “I felt perhaps a deeper amount
of chagrin and disappointment than I have ever
experienced since that date. If chosen, I would
probably have been working there as a village
doctor still.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>
<p>In 1831 Simpson returned to his university studies,
his brother David having commenced business in Stockbridge,
Edinburgh, and being able to accommodate the
young doctor. He assisted in maintaining himself by
becoming assistant to Dr. Gairdner. Thus he was enabled
to complete his university course and take his M.D.
degree in 1832, giving as his inaugural thesis an essay
on “Death from Inflammation.” This attracted much
attention, especially from Dr. John Thomson, Professor
of Pathology, who at once requested him to act as his
assistant with a salary of £50, which the young man
made sufficient for all his necessities. In this capacity
he prepared a catalogue of the museum of the pathological
department. His first experience of obstetric
study in attending Professor Hamilton’s lectures had
not left his mind under a compulsion to pursue the
subject deeply, but Dr. Thomson saw that his assistant,
soft-mannered but full of decisive activity, was the
very man to succeed in midwifery practice, and he
therefore advised him to devote himself specially to it.
Another great characteristic was his power of winning
the confidence of others, and especially of getting his
patients to tell him what it was most important that he
should know. But he went immediately to work to
become learned in his subject, and then to turn over in
his mind everything that he had learnt, until it assumed
a new aspect. He always sought new and better ways,
and if any department of practice or theory appeared
to him defective, he restlessly applied his mind to
invent or imagine some improvement. And he had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
absorbing desire to gratify his family by achieving
success. When his sister Mary told him in 1834 he
was injuring his health by overwork, he replied, seriously,
“Well, I am sure it’s just to please you all.”</p>

<p>Simpson’s first important paper, on the Diseases
of the Placenta, delivered before the Royal Medical
Society in 1835, at once showed a master hand. It
was translated into French, German, and Italian. He
began by exhaustively studying the previous history
of every subject he took up, and then tested others’
opinions and facts by his own observation. One of his
earliest papers includes nearly one hundred references
to previous literature, including many authorities, showing
an unusual range of reading. If he could not read
the language of an author he got some one who could to
do so, and give him the material bearing on his point
of inquiry. But while no man regarded more highly
than he the patient achievements of the past, no man
sat more loosely to tradition and convention.</p>

<p>In 1833 Simpson became a member of the Royal
Medical and Physical Societies of Edinburgh. Of the
former he was soon President. A writer in the
<cite>Scotsman</cite> for May 10, 1870, thus described his appearance
in that capacity. After speaking of his long
tangled hair, and very large head, he says: “A poet has
since described him as one of ‘leonine aspect.’ Not
such do we remember him. A pale, large, rather
flattish face, massive, brent brows, from under which
shone eyes now piercing as it were to your inmost soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
now melting into almost feminine tenderness, and
coarsish nose, with dilated nostrils, a finely-chiselled
mouth, which seemed the most expressive feature of the
face, and capable of being made at will the exponent of
every passion and emotion. Who could describe that
smile? When even the sun has tried it he has failed,
and yet who can recall those features and not realise
it as it played round the delicate lines of the upper
lip, where firmness was strangely blended with other
and apparently opposing qualities? Then his peculiar,
rounded, soft body and limbs, as if he had retained the
infantile form in adolescence, presented a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
which even had we never seen it again would have
remained indelibly impressed on our memory.”</p>

<p>In 1832 Alexander and Mary Simpson both married.
Alexander’s wife, however, became as attached as his
sister to James, and there was no interruption to the
family helpfulness. When cholera appeared in Bathgate,
Alexander made a will securing a provision for
James if he died. “I trust,” wrote this true brother,
“every one of you will look to him. But I dare say
every one of you has a pleasure in doing him good by
stealth, as I have had myself.” The brothers Alexander
and John enabled James to visit London and the
Continent in 1835 to see a variety of practice; his
travelling companion was Dr. Douglas Maclagan,
afterwards Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at
Edinburgh. On his return Simpson gained some
practice, but chiefly among those who could <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>pay him
little or nothing. In May 1836 he obtained the situation
of house-surgeon to the Lying-in Hospital, which
he held for a year. This soon led to an increase of
practice among better-paying patients. He now gave
some courses of lectures on Midwifery in the Extra-Academical
School, which were well received, besides
being appointed interim lecturer on Pathology, when his
friend Dr. Thomson had resigned. He gave great labour
to the preparation of his lectures, besides continuing
to publish original papers on Midwifery. At this time
he rose repeatedly at three in the morning, when he
did not sit up all night. But with all his work he
found time for social enjoyment, for family interests,
for messages to old schoolfellows in humble life.</p>

<p>Neither now nor at any time did Simpson lose his
habit of plain speech. He did not always conciliate
others by his outspoken expressions, and he did not
care to wrap up unpleasant truths in honeyed words.
In 1839 some hasty words which passed between
Simpson and Dr. Lewins of Leith in reference to an
anonymous letter written by the latter, nearly led to a
duel; but, fortunately, friends were able to persuade
them that both were to blame, and an amicable reconciliation
was effected. In the same year, that in which
also he had commenced housekeeping on his own
account, Simpson became a candidate for the Chair of
Midwifery, vacated by Dr. Hamilton’s resignation. The
contest was a very severe one, Dr. Evory Kennedy of
Dublin having strong claims. Simpson strained every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
nerve to secure testimonials and to influence electors,
publishing an octavo volume of testimonials, extending
to more than 200 pages. He was finally elected Professor
on the 4th February 1840 by a majority of one
vote only, at the age of twenty-eight, with no advantages
of social position or long experience to back him.
A few weeks previously (December 26, 1839) he had
married his second cousin, Miss Jessie Grindlay, of
Liverpool, to whom he had long been attached.</p>

<p>But difficulties were not over when the election had
taken place. The pecuniary cost of the canvass was
about £500, chiefly in printing and postage; and
Simpson had less than no money; he was considerably
in debt to his relatives. His new colleagues had to a
large extent opposed him, preferring Dr. Kennedy; they
continued to oppose him, not fancying their association
with a small baker’s son. Practice began to flow in,
but it necessitated taking a larger house, keeping a
carriage, and much greater expenditure; and it was
some time before the young couple could make both
ends meet. Demands from old friends or from poor
people for help, crowded on Simpson faster than fees;
and his kindly heart did more for them than sober
judgment would warrant. He frequently sat up all
night writing for the press. He was beset remarkably
early by philanthropic projectors, self-interested promoters,
young aspirants to fame, and men anxious to
bring forward a pill calculated to make people live to
the age of Methusaleh, or desirous of the Doctor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
interest to get them permission to fish in one of his
patients’ streams. Nervous headaches and acute pains
began to cast their horrible shadows over his life; but
work was scarcely ever remitted. His lectures were
immediately a great success; he had the largest class
in the University. Additional seats had to be supplied,
and then there was not room for all to sit. His
cares had meanwhile been increased by the birth of a
daughter, a fortnight before the session began.</p>

<p>Simpson’s untiring activity could not content itself,
however, with strictly professional subjects. Before
the end of his first session of professional lectures, he
began to work at a memoir which received the title of
“Antiquarian Notices of Leprosy and Leper-Houses in
Scotland and England.” In it he makes nearly five
hundred references to out-of-the-way authorities, and
in the appendix is a list and notices of one hundred and
nineteen leper-houses which he had traced in Britain.
The memoir is a mine of valuable antiquarian information.</p>

<p>By the end of 1842 his pecuniary position was
assured beyond all doubt, although his benevolence
would have made this difficult had not his skill become
so famed. His success when little over thirty years
of age was marvellous; the hotels were filled with his
patients, and his practice was said to be worth many
thousands of pounds a year to these establishments.
His house had to be enlarged to receive some who
insisted on remaining in the closest proximity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> the
great doctor. But in the whirl of practice one fault
became prominent. Methodical and exhaustive in his
literary researches, and possessed of a powerful memory,
he could not be persuaded to make systematic notes of
his appointments, and seemed to be incapable of so
planning out his time as to spend it to the greatest
advantage for his patients. He not unfrequently forgot
a definite appointment, and was sometimes overpersuaded
by pushing people or by professional friends
to attend to cases out of their proper turn. That he
ever consciously did any one an injustice either for pay
or without it is quite untrue. But he was blamed as
if he had. He was indeed only too careless about
money, and frequently too regardless of his own interest
to demand a proper fee. His receipts were stuffed at
once into his pockets, which were emptied at night, he
knowing nothing of their contents before. Sometimes
a fee was received in a letter, and neither taken out
nor acknowledged. Once he received £10 thus, when
a much larger fee might have been expected, and
several notes of expostulation followed on his neglect
to acknowledge its receipt. One stormy night Simpson
was much disturbed in sleep by the rattling of a
window. He got up, felt in his pocket for a bit of
paper, and lighted on the £10 note, which was devoted
to the tightening of the window-frame. On Mrs.
Simpson discovering the nature of the bit of paper in
the morning, he merely replied, “Oh, it’s <em>that</em> £10.”
A sample of ridiculous expostulations is the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
where repeated letters asked Dr. Simpson’s opinion
whether three leeches should not be applied to a hip-joint,
instead of two, which the family medical man
recommended.</p>

<p>In the midst of practice and lectures, he found time
to write or dictate many a brief or lengthy article on
obstetric practice or diseases of women, always practical,
always exhausting previous authorities. It was in this
direction especially that his mind was ever at work.
Then when he had come to a conclusion, he withheld
no item of it. “Keen to perceive the truth,” says the
<cite>Scotsman</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he was equally vigorous in his announcement
of it, and cared little to what cherished opinion
his statements might run counter. Hence came contests
where little quarter was given or received. He
was a dangerous antagonist to meet at a joust, and
though he could use the keen edge of steel, he oftener
despatched his antagonist with a heavy mace of facts
or figures, which those who had neither his industry
nor his powers of memory could neither refute nor set
aside. Hence he made many enemies, for he had run
counter to many prejudices, and the old spirit which
had opposed his election to the professorial chair
cropped out ever and anon, showing that it was
smothered, not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: extinguished.&rdquo;">extinguished.</ins></p>

<p>It should ever be remembered that Simpson’s greatness
was established before he had introduced chloroform,
and depended on his unsurpassed skill in obstetrics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>and diseases of women, while yet he was a most accomplished
general physician. Already, in January 1847,
when he was only just beginning to study anæsthetics,
he was made one of the Queen’s Physicians for Scotland.
We cannot here attempt a history of previous efforts
to secure immunity or relief from pain, but it is evident
Simpson was in this respect not a man marvellously in
advance of his age; the subject was in the air; unceasing
efforts at improvement were being made. Before
the end of the last century the brilliant chemical discoveries
of Priestley had led to his suggestion that
drugs might be administered in definite quantities by
inhalation through the lungs. Oxygen was the first
gas inhaled for medicinal purposes; and in 1795 Dr.
Pearson of Birmingham prescribed the inhalation of
ether in cases of consumption, being followed ten
years later by Dr. Warren of Boston, U.S.A. In 1800
Sir Humphry Davy, when superintending Beddoes’
Pneumatic Institution at Bristol, founded principally
for the medicinal inhalation of oxygen, began to study
the effects of nitrous oxide, which he employed, after
he had become familiar with its intoxicating effects, to
relieve the pain of a severe inflammation of his own
gums. In publishing his account of its successful
inhalation he said, “As nitrous oxide in its extensive
operation seems capable of destroying physical pain,
it may probably be used with advantage during surgical
operations in which no great effusion of blood takes
place.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus we must credit Sir Humphry Davy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
with the most original observation and experiment on
the subject of anæsthetics: another instance in which
the investigator seeking to advance science has made
an observation and suggestion bearing on the welfare
of the whole of mankind. His pupil and successor,
Faraday, in 1818 announced that sulphuric ether vapour,
when inhaled, produced similar effects to nitrous oxide.
Here closes the record of anæsthetics for many years,
practically we believe because medicine and surgery
had not yet become sufficiently scientific to discern
their value.</p>

<p>In 1835 Robert Collyer, an American medical student,
inhaled ether at a chemical lecture by Professor Turner
at University College, London, being himself made
insensible, in company with other students; he noted
that his fellow-students under its influence became
insensible to pain. In December 1839, Collyer, near
New Orleans, reduced a dislocation of the hip for one
of his father’s negroes who had fallen down in insensibility
on inhaling the fumes of rum. The negro
showed no sign of pain. Collyer soon after identified
this narcotic state with that produced by mesmerism,
under which also some operations were painlessly performed.
Collyer lectured on these subjects in 1840 and
subsequent years in Philadelphia, Boston, Liverpool,
and other places. He made mesmeric and narcotising
experiments, the latter with a mixture in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>vapour of alcohol with poppy seeds and coriander steeped
in it was inhaled, and in 1842 he states that he administered
his alcoholic mixture to a patient in Philadelphia,
during tooth-drawing, with a painless result. In 1844
an American chemical lecturer named Coulton exhibited
the properties of nitrous oxide at a lecture
given at Hartford, Connecticut, at which Horace Wells,
a dentist practising there, was present. Having a tooth
which he himself wished to get extracted, Wells
invited Coulton to administer nitrous oxide to him.
This was successfully done, and during Wells’ insensibility
his tooth was removed by a friend, Dr. Riggs.
Wells on recovering consciousness exclaimed, “A new
era in tooth-pulling!” and at once attempted to introduce
the practice at Hartford and at Boston; but not
using the gas in purity, and not being sufficiently skilful
in its administration, his attempts often failed, and
at Boston he was hissed, and gave up his efforts in
despair. Later, when anæsthetics had become firmly
established, he again sought unsuccessfully to introduce
nitrous oxide, and at last put an end to his life. It is
sad to think of this fate for a man who, with a little
more education and a little more perseverance, might
have reaped a great harvest of fame.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We cannot go into the controversy as to which
American has the greatest merit in the introduction of
sulphuric ether as an anæsthetic. Suffice it to mention
that Charles Jackson, a chemist of Boston, who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>present at Wells’ demonstration in 1840, first experimented
on himself by inhaling pure sulphuric ether,
and having produced insensibility, communicated his
discovery to W. T. G. Morton, a dentist who had
been present at Wells’ demonstration, and prevailed
on him to employ it. Morton afterwards alleged that
this step was taken independently on his part.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1846, Morton administered ether
to Eben Frost for tooth-drawing with complete success,
and in October following it was used in an important
operation by Dr. J. C. Warren at the Massachusetts
General Hospital. The news arrived in England before
the end of 1846, and on December 19th, James
Robinson, a dentist of Gower Street, London, was the
first to operate under ether in this country for the
removal of a tooth. On December 21 Robert Liston
employed it most successfully at University College
Hospital in an amputation of the thigh and in the
removal of a great toe-nail, one of the most exquisitely
painful operations. Its general adoption followed in
the first few months of 1847. Dr. Simpson, as early
as January 9, 1847, after previously inhaling it himself,
used it in order to relieve pain in childbirth, and
found that its anæsthetic effects produced no stoppage
or perceptible alteration in the muscular contractions
of the womb. This and other cases of his were quickly
published, and justify his claim to having introduced
ether in its application to midwifery practice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>
<p>The inconveniences occasioned by the smell of
sulphuric ether, the considerable doses required to be
given, and its tendency to irritate the bronchial tubes,
led Simpson to inquire for and to try other analogous
liquids. He was recommended, among others by Dr.
Gregory, to try chloroform, discovered by Soubeiran in
1831 and Liebig in 1832, and accurately investigated
by Dumas in 1835. He concluded after much labour,
and the expenditure of some hundreds of pounds, that
chloroform, without the unpleasant smell of ether, produced
more rapid effects with a smaller dose, and he
very soon began to use it in midwifery and to introduce
it to his surgical friends for operations. It
was brought before the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical
Society on the 10th November 1847; and so well-known
and favoured did it become that in a very short
time Simpson’s Edinburgh chemists were manufacturing
7000 doses a day. Here we might almost stop in this
record, but for two things, one the controversies Simpson
had as to the impropriety and irreligiousness of removing
pain, supposed to be one of the Creator’s ordinances
which ought not to be mitigated; and the other, the
deaths that began to occur under the administration of
chloroform. As to the first, a specimen of the objectors
is furnished by a clergyman, who wrote “that
chloroform was a decoy of Satan, apparently offering
itself to bless woman; but in the end it will harden
society, and rob God of the deep earnest cries which
arise in time of trouble for help.” Even the relief of
pain in surgical operations was held by many to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
unwarrantable. But a powerful counter-argument was
found, in the much greater ease and certainty of
success with which surgeons could now perform their
operations when the cries and writhings of the patient
were removed. The controversy that ensued, however,
would fill a volume, and Simpson in it proved himself,
as ever, a hard hitter.</p>

<p>For many years scarcely anything but chloroform
was used for producing anæsthesia; but gradually
numerous unexpected deaths under its administration
led many to think that it had too depressing an effect on
the action of the heart, in some cases at least, and led to
the trial of other agents, including bichloride of methylene,
the reintroduction of ether, and nitrous oxide.
The two latter are very largely used at present, and so
also is a mixture composed of one part by measure of
alcohol to two of chloroform and three of ether, also
known as the A.C.E. mixture, from the first letters of
the three constituents. This is now considered by
many to be safer than chloroform. What will be the
judgment of future experience we can have no pretensions
to decide.</p>

<p>We cannot give in detail the subsequent events of
Dr. Simpson’s life. It became more busy and active,
more benevolent, and more distinctly religious as years
went on. He refused advantageous offers to settle
in London, and instead patients came from all parts
of the world to consult him in Edinburgh. His
hospitality was unbounded. His daily breakfasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> and
luncheons have been graphically described by a well-known
poet. “Assembled unceremoniously in a moderate-sized
room, with little in common save the wish
to meet their host, you found a company drawn together
from every latitude and longitude, social and geographical.
Of all this motley party there is probably
hardly one who is not notable, and the grades and
classes of eminence run through the whole gamut of
social distinction from duchesses, poets, and earls, down
to the author of the last successful book on cookery,
the inventor of the oddest new patent, a Greek courtier,
a Russian gentleman, or a German count. At your
elbow the last survivor of some terrible shipwreck is
telling his story to the wife of that northern ambassador,
who is meeting, with the softest Scandinavian
dialect, the strong maritime Danish of the clever
State secretary opposite. Behind you a knot of
American physicians, just arrived, are discussing in
a loud voice, a speech in Congress, or agreeing, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto
voce</i>
, on the particular professional topic upon which
they have come to consult the great authority. Turn
for a moment from this sculptor, who is waiting to
ask the opinion of the many-sided professor on the
sketches which he is now showing to that portrait-painter,
and to learn which of them shall be done in
marble for the nobleman whose attention the doctor
has found time to direct to the rising young artist,
and you may catch something of yonder violent discussion
between those arrivals from Australia, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
have come from the land of gold in search of what
gold cannot buy.”</p>

<p>But it is by no means only in connection with
ether and chloroform that Simpson introduced a new
practice. Besides numberless suggestions and novel
ideas in midwifery, he brought forward (in 1859, after
some years of study) a totally new method of closing
arteries after operations and in substitution for ligatures,
so often the cause of inflammation. Long before John
Hunter had pointed out that needles and pins when
passed into and embedded in the living body seldom or
never produced any inflammatory action. Simpson was
struck with the idea that slender sharp-pointed needles
or pins of non-oxidisable iron, somewhat like hare-lip
needles, might be used to close together the walls or
flaps of wounds, at the same time keeping the blood-vessels
closed. These pins could be withdrawn very
early, and would greatly favour healing at the earliest
possible moment. The new method, called acupressure,
of course met with much opposition, and Simpson
was severely censured for meddling in a preserve
strictly limited to the surgeon. But the help of the
Aberdeen surgeons, Keith and Pirrie, was of great
service in promoting the fair trial of the practice.
His attack on the prevailing hospital system in 1869
was one of his later crusades, and he certainly accumulated
a great store of facts showing the unhealthiness
of the existing conditions of aggregation in crowded
hospitals. His advocacy of a separate system in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
hospital construction, and of limiting the number of
patients close together, of course drew on him further
fierce opposition. We cannot here refer to his strong
exposure of the fallacies of homœopathy, his vigorous
actions in connection with the University of Edinburgh,
or the numerous antiquarian papers which his
prolific pen gave forth. Every year had crowded into
it three times as much research as a very industrious
man could manage, ten times as much controversy,
and twice as much practice. Honours came thick
upon him. In 1856 he was greatly gratified by the
French Academy’s award of the Monthyon Prize of
2000 francs for “most important benefits done to
humanity.” At the beginning of 1866 he was created
a baronet. In 1869 the freedom of Edinburgh was
presented to him.</p>

<p>Heavy affliction came now and again to embitter his
life. Several children were taken from him in the
prime of their life, including his eldest son, who
showed great promise of a brilliant medical future,
but was cut off within a fortnight after his father was
made a baronet. In later life he became an ardent
church worker, having joined the Free Church of
Scotland when the Disruption took place. 1870
found the vital machine much out of order. Heart
pain—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angina pectoris</i>
—so often the scourge of medical
men, came more frequently with its terrible strain.
But he never relaxed his work in the intervals, until
absolutely compelled. In one of his later conversations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
he said, “How old am I? Fifty-nine. Well, I
have done some work. <em>I wish I had been busier.</em>”
One of his expressions showed his distaste for
theology. “I like the plain simple Gospel truth, and
don’t care to go into questions beyond that.” During
almost his last night he was inexpressibly comforted
by having with him his brother Alexander, who had
watched over him with such tenderness from childhood.
He sat on the pillow with Sir James’s head on his knee,
and the sufferer again and again slowly uttered the
words, “Oh, Sandy, Sandy!” He died on May 6, 1870.
He would have been buried in Westminster Abbey but
for his own express wish to be buried in Warriston
Cemetery, Edinburgh. His funeral was such as
Edinburgh had, it is said, never witnessed before,
business being generally suspended. His widow survived
him but a few weeks, dying on the 17th June
following. His eldest surviving son, Walter Grindlay,
succeeded him in the baronetcy.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR SPENCER WELLS AND OVARIOTOMY.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Thomas Spencer Wells</span>, whose career in the
revival of the operation of ovariotomy has attracted
very widespread attention and interest, was
born in 1818, being the eldest son of Mr. William
Wells of St. Alban’s, Herts.</p>

<p>Without being formally apprenticed, he enjoyed
many of the advantages of the old apprenticeship
system, under an able country practitioner, Michael
Thomas Sadler, of Barnsley, Yorkshire. Subsequently
he spent a year with a parish doctor in Leeds, attending
the Leeds Infirmary, and Hey’s and Teale’s lectures.
The session 1837-8 was passed in Dublin, and there
Graves and Stokes largely influenced the young
surgeon. Continuing his course of culture in varied
fields, he went to St. Thomas’s, London, and was a
zealous pupil of J. H. Green, Travers, and Tyrrell.
Here he obtained a prize for the best reports of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
mortem</i>
 examinations. Becoming a member of the
College of Surgeons in 1841, he entered the navy as
assistant-surgeon, and spent six years in the Naval
Hospital at Malta.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>
<p>In 1853 Sir Spencer Wells settled in practice in
London, and in 1854 became attached to the Samaritan
Hospital, then a dispensary for the diseases of women.
At this time Sir Spencer states he knew less of this
branch of the profession than of any other. In his
younger days he had attended an unusual number of
midwifery cases, but latterly his practice had been
almost exclusively surgical, with a strong tendency
towards ophthalmic surgery. It was at this time
that he first became interested in the subject that has
made his name so widely known.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the ovaries of women have
been subject to diseased growths and fluid accumulations,
for which there was scarcely a remedy, except
when fluid could be drawn off through one or more
punctures, and fatal results were the almost inevitable
sequel of these diseases. Towards the end of the
seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries,
several medical men proposed to remove the diseased
organ by an incision in the front wall of the abdomen.
William Hunter in 1762 put forward a method by
which this operation, otherwise full of danger, might be
rendered feasible; and John Hunter, lecturing in 1785,
favoured the idea of removal, considering that the
opening would not necessarily constitute a highly
dangerous wound. In 1798 Chambon, in a book on
diseases of women, published at Paris, strongly argued
in favour of the operation. Although it does not
appear that he ever himself performed it, he says, “I
am convinced that a time will come when this operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
will be considered practicable in more cases than I
have enumerated, and that the objections against its
performance will cease.” John Bell also has a share of
credit in this matter, for in his lectures on surgery at
Edinburgh in 1794 he dwelt with much force on the
practicability of removing ovarian tumours by operation.
It was reserved, however, for a pupil of his,
Ephraim M’Dowell, from Virginia, to perform the first
modern operation of ovariotomy for disease. He settled
in practice in Kentucky in 1795, and in 1809 carried
into effect this novel operation upon a middle-aged
woman, who survived to complete her seventy-eighth
year in 1841. Thus an American had the glory of first
boldly starting in the new path.</p>

<p>It was difficult to give the new operation a start in
England. “It must be remembered,” says Sir Spencer
Wells, “that, at that time of day, the mortality from
all operations was much greater than it is now; that
the sick and diseased were more passively quiescent
under their maladies and less tolerant of any surgical
suggestions, just as we ourselves find to be the case
among the unroused population of an outlying agricultural
district; that they were not buoyed up, as modern
women are, by the histories and promises of painless
extirpations under chloroform or methylene; and that,
without any mawkish sentimentalism, surgeons themselves
had to encounter the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peine forte et dure</i> of
their suppressed sympathy, and nerve themselves up
to the infliction of the most deliberate and tedious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
eviscerative vivisection. The disease was looked upon
as a mystery, and its ending in death as a matter of
course; and, instead of being accompanied, as we now
see it, by fretful resistance and chafings to escape, it
only led to stolid endurance or religious submission;
and on the part of the profession, to pity and endeavours
to alleviate the inevitable misery. But M’Dowell
was a free man, in a new country, clear from the conventional
trammels of old-world practice, found his
patients in the most favourable conditions of animal
life, seems to have had one of those incomprehensible
runs of luck upon which a man’s fate and reputation
so often turn if he has the sagacity and energy to put
such fortunate accidents to good account, and was
happy, as those usually are who can afford or constrain
themselves to wait, in finding suitable time, place,
persons, and opportunity for working into fact the
notions of his tutor, Bell. He lost only the last of his
first five cases of ovariotomy, and thus, as it were,
established at the outset what until recently was complacently
regarded as a satisfactory standard of mortality
for so serious an operation.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>As a surgeon M’Dowell was “cautious, calm, and
firm, paying great attention to the details of his operations
and treatment, and selecting and drilling his
assistants with great care.” In 1879 a granite obelisk
was raised to his memory in the cemetery where he
was buried, near his home, in commemoration of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>courageous and important work.</p>

<p>Long after M’Dowell’s operations became known,
a case was discovered as far back as August 1701, in
which Robert Houstoun, a Glasgow surgeon, operated
on a woman for a large tumour in a fashion somewhat
anticipatory of modern ovariotomy. She recovered,
and lived sixteen years afterwards. So often are
anticipations of great improvements to be found, that
it appears that the merit, like the difficulty of actually
making a thing practicable and practised, is as great as,
or greater than, that of discovery.</p>

<p>Several American surgeons followed M’Dowell, but
the operation did not come rapidly into vogue, partly
because anæsthetics had not yet been introduced.
Lizars of Edinburgh had one successful and one
unsuccessful case in 1825. Dr. Granville attempted it
in London in 1827, but the operation was abandoned
on account of the difficulties met with: fortunately the
patient recovered. In 1836 Dr. Jeaffreson of Framlingham
first operated successfully by means of the short
incision recommended by William Hunter; the patient
recovered and bore a family afterwards. In the same
year several other provincial surgeons were equally
successful. In 1840 Mr. Benjamin Phillips operated
unsuccessfully at the Marylebone Infirmary. In 1842
Dr. Charles Clay of Manchester commenced a long
series of operations, operating four times in the year,
three times successfully. The first successful case in
London was by Mr. Walne in November 1842. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
this time operations were not infrequent. In September
1846 Mr. Cæsar Hawkins proved for the first time
that success was possible in a London hospital; his
precautions and his directions were most excellent. In
June 1848 Dr. Charles Clay published a series of 32
cases with only 10 deaths, and he continued to operate
for many years until he had performed 395 operations
with only 101 deaths, slightly above 25 per cent. He
used long ligatures. In 1850 Mr. Duffin, in London,
employed an important improvement in procedure.</p>

<p>Sir Spencer Wells’s medical education and study in
all these years had not led to his paying any attention
to the subject. It was evidently outside the prevailing
ideas of most of the medical schools. His opinion in
1848 was certainly against the justifiability of the
operation. In 1853 or 1854 he became acquainted
with Mr. Baker Brown, and in the latter year assisted
him at the Middlesex Hospital in his eighth case of
ovariotomy. This was the first time he had seen the
operation attempted, but the patient died. Several
unsuccessful cases led Brown to give up his attempts
entirely from March 1856 to October 1858.</p>

<p>When the Crimean War broke out, Sir Spencer Wells
betook himself to the army in the East. There he learnt
much of the freedom with which the abdomen might be
injured and yet recovery take place if the constitution
was good and other things were favourable. He saw
frightful cases of laceration by fragments of shell recover
after careful cleansing and accurate closure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the wounds. He returned to London much less afraid
than before of abdominal wounds. Renewing his work
at the Samaritan Hospital, he at first saw very little of
ovarian disease, and it was not till December 1857 that
he made his first attempt to perform ovariotomy, which,
however, on Baker Brown’s advice, he did not carry to
completion. His second attempt was completed, with
Brown’s assistance; but the latter did not recommence
to operate himself until after an interval of more than
two years and a half.</p>

<p>Sir Spencer Wells has given a graphic account of his
early experiences.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “It would be difficult to imagine,”
he says, “a position more disheartening than that in
which I was placed when making my first trials of
ovariotomy. The first attempt, as I have said, was a
complete failure, and strengthened not only in the
minds of others, but in my own mind, the fear that I
might be entering upon a path which would lead rather
to an unenviable notoriety than to a sound professional
reputation. And if I had not seen increasing numbers
of poor women hopelessly suffering, almost longing for
death, anxious for relief at any risk, I should probably
have acquiesced in the general conviction—have been
content with palliative tapping, or making some further
trials of incision and drainage, or of iodine-injection, or
of pressure, rather than have hazarded anything more
in the way of ovariotomy. It may be forgotten now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>but it is true, that at that time everything was against
the venture. The medical press had denounced the
operation, both in principle and practice, in the strongest
terms. At the medical societies the speakers of the
highest authority had condemned it most emphatically.
The example of the men who had practised it was not
followed; some of them had given it up. Only once
had a successful result been obtained in any of our
large metropolitan hospitals, that by Cæsar Hawkins,
at St. George’s Hospital, in 1846, and he never undertook
it a second time. Every other attempt—at Guy’s
Hospital by Morgan, Key, and Bransby Cooper, at St.
Thomas’s by Solly—had ended in death.” In 1858
three cases were undertaken, and all with success,
which did much to confirm Mr. Wells in his new
practice. The fourth he lost, and to explain the cause
he made some experiments upon animals, which led to
important improvements in methods, yet during 1859
five out of eleven operations had fatal results.</p>

<p>The translation in 1860, by Mr. John Clay of
Birmingham, of Kiwisch’s “Diseases of the Ovaries,”
with its valuable tables showing the results of all
recorded cases, was of great importance to the progress
of ovariotomy. Since then vast improvements
have been introduced, the mistakes of earlier operators
corrected, bichloride of methylene has been used with
gratifying results instead of chloroform, precautions
have been taken to prevent the access of any taint of
infectious disease, every medical man present at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
operation has been put under strict inquiry as to his
not having recently been in a dissecting or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
mortem</i>
 room, and the utmost possible purification of
house, room, bedding, clothing, and instruments has
been practised. Indeed some precautions have been
so stringently insisted on as to give considerable
offence at times. The old vegetable material for ligatures
and sutures, coarse whipcord or twine, has been
given up, and after many trials of metallic wires pure
silk has been settled upon as the most trustworthy.
In fact it is entirely absorbed without needing to be
pulled out again. The multitude of intricate details
involved precludes our giving an account of the stages
by which the present perfection has been reached.
In 1864 Mr. Wells, in pursuance of a pledge he had
given to record and publish his entire experience,
favourable and unfavourable, published a full account
of his first 114 cases. Since then two extended records,
one in 1872 giving an account of 500 cases, and a
second in 1882 with 1071 cases, have been published.
The most remarkable thing in the history is the gradual
diminution in mortality. In the first hundred cases
the deaths were thirty-four; in the last they diminished
to eleven; in the seventy-one cases following the first
thousand only four died, while sixty-seven recovered.
This is notwithstanding the fact that Sir Spencer Wells
is often called upon to treat patients rejected by other
surgeons as unfavourable cases. A recent record by
Thomas Keith, an Aberdeen surgeon, in which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
mortality of only three and a half per cent. has occurred,
even outdoes this astonishing result. It is
needless to relate how the operation has been adopted
by most Continental surgeons of mark, and with
excellent results.</p>

<p>We may note that already in 1864 Mr. Wells had
treated of hospital atmosphere, organic germs as causes
of excessive mortality, and commented on the researches
of Polli with sulphur and the sulphites,
before as yet the antiseptic treatment had come prominently
forward. When Mr. Lister’s system became
established, Mr. Wells gladly adopted all its essentials
in his operations—the spray, carbolised sponges, instruments,
&amp;c. He is convinced that by these precautions
those patients who have recovered have suffered much
less from fever, while convalescence has been more
rapid than it used to be. In fact, the general result
of the ovariotomy of the past twenty-five years is
“thousands of perishing women have been rescued
from death; many more thousands of years of human
life, health, enjoyment, and usefulness have been given
to the race, and to all future victims of a malady before
inevitable in its fatality, consolation, hope, and almost
certainty of cure.”</p>

<p>The good influence of this success has, Sir James
Paget says, extended to every department of operative
surgery, and will always continue to be felt. It has
led to an extension of the whole domain of peritoneal
surgery, leading surgeons to attempt and persevere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
until successful in many operations formerly considered
quite out of reach.</p>

<p>Sir Spencer Wells is by no means content with
promoting the progress of operative surgery; he looks
forward to prevention with the greatest hope, and
advocates measures calculated to promote accurate
research in pathology. He is a strong supporter of
any possible action by the College of Surgeons in this
direction. He says: “While we modern surgeons congratulate
our science on its liberation from the trammels
of tradition; upon its working in an atmosphere cleared
of the mist of superstition; upon the changing of
its mode of action from a blind grappling with the
phantom entities of a disease to a study and manipulation
of overnourished or degenerating tissues; upon
its having laws which can be understood and rules of
practice which can be followed, we ought not to overlook
one fact, which perhaps is more evident to outsiders
than to ourselves, standing as we do in the dust
and turmoil of the arena of our work. I mean that that
work, good and useful as it is, has too much the character
of what is technically called ‘salvaging’—is too
much in correlation with what is done by the lifeboat
service.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wells had long been a member of the Council of
the College of Surgeons when in 1882-3 he became its
President. In 1882 he was created a baronet. He has
by no means limited himself to questions of operative
surgery. His public efforts have been frequently directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
towards important subjects of state and municipal polity,
sanitary matters, the abatement of the smoke nuisance,
the securing of the health of passengers on board
ship, the hygienic condition of hospitals, and perhaps
most important of all, the mode of disposal of the dead.
His views on the evils of the present system are well
set forth in a letter he addressed to the <cite>Times</cite> on March
3, 1885, from which we make the following extract:—</p>

<p>“In this metropolitan district in the twenty-five years
1859-1883, the deaths registered number 1,896,314.
Of course, the dead have been buried, and with scarcely
an exception, in and around London. Grant that in ten
years a body may become harmless—although I do not
at all believe that it does so within twenty years in our
soil and climate—can any imagination conceive the enormous
mass of decaying animal matter by which we are
surrounded? Could any one be surprised at the outbreak
of some devastating pestilence a hundredfold
more destructive than the plague or black death of the
Middle Ages? And ought not every sanitary reformer
to aid the revival of the ancient practice which would
convert the existing cemeteries, so rapidly becoming
sources of danger to the public health, into permanently
beautiful gardens, receptacles for vases and cinerary
urns, which would encourage sculpture, mural decoration,
and coloured glass-work; while in our country
churches the ashes of the people might again repose in
death near the scene of their work in life perfectly
harmless, instead of polluting the earth of the church-yard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and the water drunk by the surviving people, or
being carried far from their homes and places of
worship to some distant cemetery, which before long
must become overcrowded and pestilential. Public
sentiment may for a time revolt at an innovation, but
a very little reflection will bring most people to agree
with part of the Bishop of Manchester’s address on
consecrating a new cemetery. He said:—</p>

<p>“‘Here is another hundred acres of land withdrawn
from the food-producing area of the country for ever....
In the same sense in which the “Sabbath was
made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,” I hold
that the earth was made, not for the dead, but for the
living. No intelligent faith can suppose that any
Christian doctrine is affected by the manner in which,
or the time in which, this mortal body of ours crumbles
into dust.’”</p>

<p>Sir Spencer Wells in his frequent communications
on the subject lays much stress on the fact that such
undoubted proofs of natural death are required by the
Cremation Society before cremating a body that no
murderer or poisoner would think of getting the forms
filled up. At the Milan Crematorium a death from
poison was actually discovered in this way, when
natural death only was believed to have taken place.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR WILLIAM JENNER, BUDD, MURCHISON, AND
TYPHOID FEVER.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> no department of medical knowledge has recent
progress been more marked than in the discrimination
and the tracing of the natural history of the
diseases known as zymotic: and no man takes higher
rank in this department of investigation than Sir
<span class="smcap">William Jenner</span>. He was born at Chatham, January
30, 1815, being the son of Mr. John Jenner, and educated
at University College, London. After qualifying
as a general practitioner, he commenced practice and
obtained the appointment of Surgeon-Accoucheur to
the Royal Maternity Charity. Before long he graduated
M.D. at London University (1844), and retired
from general practice. His studies in pathology became
more and more extensive, and his merits were so far
recognised that in 1849 he was elected Professor of
Pathological Anatomy to University College, and
Assistant-Physician to University College Hospital.</p>

<p>For some years Dr. Jenner had been assiduously
studying in the London Fever Hospital, seeking to
make a straight path through the many knotty questions
then, in debate. In April 1849 he commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the publication, in the <cite>Monthly Journal of Medical
Science</cite>, of his classic paper on “Typhoid and Typhus
Fevers, an attempt to determine the question of their
identity or non-identity, by an analysis of the symptoms,
and of the appearances found after death in sixty-six
fatal cases of continued fever, observed at the London
Fever Hospital from January 1847 to February
1849.” In this he states that “with few exceptions,
British physicians have laboured to prove that typhoid
and typhus fevers are identical. The results obtained
by this analysis justify the assertion that they are
essentially distinct diseases.... For two years, in
distinguishing the two diseases by the eruption alone
not a single error has been made, so far as could be
proved by examination after death of the fatal cases,
or by the progress of the non-fatal cases after their
diagnosis was recorded.”</p>

<p>The history of previous investigations and the fluctuations
of opinion are excellently given by Dr.
Murchison in his great work on the “Continued Fevers
of Great Britain,” 1862, 2d ed. 1873. Dr. H. C.
Lombard of Geneva appears to have been the first to
state positively (in 1836) that “there were two distinct
and separate fevers in Great Britain; one of them
identical with the contagious typhus, the other a
sporadic disease, identical with the typhoid fever of
the French.” He failed, however, to point out the distinctive
eruptions and other characteristics of the two
fevers. At the same period Drs. Gerhard and Pennock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
in Philadelphia arrived at more definite conclusions,
and distinguished the typhus of Philadelphia as being
the same as British typhus, the old gaol, camp, and ship
fever, so direfully contagious and fatal; while certain
intestinal phenomena were invariably found in the other
or typhoid fever, which was rarely contagious. The
characteristic eruptions and many of the symptoms
were also accurately discriminated. These observers
were followed by others who with more or less success
and emphasis insisted on the same views. Among
these were Drs. H. C. Barlow and A. P. Stewart, both
of whom read important papers on the subject before
the Parisian Medical Society in 1840. In 1841 the
celebrated Louis in the second edition of his great
work on typhoid fever accepted the view that the
English typhus was very distinct from the fever which
he had so largely elucidated. Nevertheless many
physicians of authority strongly maintained their identity,
and the majority of the medical schools taught
this doctrine, which could not fail to retard progress.
It is obvious how much uncertain and injurious treatment
must have existed for a long period owing to the
confusion of these two diseases.</p>

<p>In his series of papers published in 1849 and 1850
Dr. Jenner confirmed and extended the distinctions
between the symptoms of the two fevers, comparing
the selected cases most minutely as regarded previous
health, complexion, sex, age, mode of attack, duration,
eruption, expression during disease, manner, hue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
face, presence of headache, delirium, loss of muscular
power, sensation, appearance of the tongue, suffering of
pain, appetite, thirst, pulse, cough, and lung symptoms,
and many other particulars, and detailed most carefully
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>
 appearances of the diseased action in
every organ.</p>

<p>As regards the age of patients, he showed by calculation
that typhoid usually attacked much younger
patients than typhus, the average age of his cases of
the one being 22 years, of the other 42 years. In
typhus, death took place on the average on the fourteenth
day, while in typhoid the average was the
thirty-second day of residence in the hospital. The
rose rash of typhoid, disappearing completely on pressure,
resuming the original appearance on the withdrawal
of pressure, was clearly discriminated from the
mulberry rash of typhus. His <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>
 observations
may be considered to have given the death-blow to the
idea that typhoid was merely typhus fever with abdominal
complications. In closing the series of papers
(April 1850) Dr. Jenner remarked, as to the suggestion
that he had drawn general conclusions from a too
limited number of facts, “A few facts, impartially
observed, minutely recorded, and carefully analysed,
are, I believe, more likely to give correct results than a
multitude of general observations; and moreover, I
believe most men would be astonished if they had in
numbers all the cases of any given disease they had
ever seen, yet concerning which they have generalised.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
The method I have adopted—however prolix it may be,
however difficult to conform to, however tedious the
details into which it leads—has this advantage, that if
the observer be honest, and capable of noting what is
before him, thinking men may judge of the value of his
facts, the force of his reasoning, and the correctness of
his conclusion; whereas general observations, while
they are totally incapable of proving anything, are
exposed to all the fallacies of definite statements,
because the one, like the other, rests ultimately on the
accuracy of the facts observed. If the observations
on which any reasoning is founded be erroneous, no
cloaking of those observations in general terms can
render the conclusions correct. It has been objected
to definite numerical statements that they mislead the
reader by an <em>appearance</em> of accuracy in cases where
there has been great inaccuracy in observation. This
objection appears to me to lie against the condition of
the reader’s mind, and not against the method.... The
more complicated the problem to be solved, the more
careful ought we to be that <em>every</em> step in its solution is
made correctly. How complex questions, such as arise
in medicine, are to be determined mentally—<i>i.e.</i>, without
the aid of figures—by ordinary men, I am at a loss
to conceive. Yet physicians think to solve, by mental
reveries, problems in comparison with which the most
difficult that the most renowned calculators ever
answered were child’s play; and not only do they
think to solve these problems, but to carry in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
minds for years the complicated materials by which
they are to be solved.”</p>

<p>Another important branch of Dr. Jenner’s inquiry
dealt with the question as to whether the specific cause
of these diseases is distinct or the same, the latter being
then the preponderant opinion. In a paper on this
subject communicated to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical
Society, on December 11, 1849, he showed that
in 1847-8-9, on analysing all the cases in which two
or more fever patients came from the same house,
scarcely a single instance occurred where typhus and
typhoid came at the same period from the same house.
In nearly all cases the two diseases came from quite
distinct localities. No transitional cases occurred between
the two; the rash of typhoid did not graduate
into that of typhus. It was several times observed
that when a succession of cases came from the same
locality, or arose apparently from the same cause, they
agreed remarkably in symptoms or other features.
Thus Dr. Jenner considered he had definitely proved
that typhus and typhoid proceeded from perfectly
distinct causes, a result which recent medical science
accepts without reserve.</p>

<p>Although the contributions of this distinguished
physician have been of such high worth, and his subsequent
success so great in practice, he is far from being
wedded to the view that any great step forward in
medicine has been the direct result of the labours of a
single man. Long after his early papers, in addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the British Medical Association in 1869, Sir William
Jenner said: “The silent workers render most efficient
aid, the results of their unspoken experience confirming
or refuting the published assertions of the few.” He
believes that no science has advanced more during the
present epoch than medicine, and that it has progressed
equally as a practical art.</p>

<p>Dr. Jenner’s appointments include, among a crowd
of others, those of Physician to University College
Hospital (1854), Professor of Clinical Medicine (1857)
and of the Principles and Practice of Medicine (1862),
Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children (1852),
Assistant-Physician to the Fever Hospital (1853).
In 1864 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society,
and became President of the College of Physicians in
1881. In 1861 he was appointed Physician-Extraordinary
to the Queen, and attended the Prince-Consort
in his last illness. In 1862 he became Physician-in-Ordinary
to the Queen, and has frequently attended
her Majesty. He was made a baronet in 1868, and
further advanced to the dignity of a K.C.B. in 1872 for
his services during the Prince of Wales’s illness from
typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Sir William Jenner has published eminently valuable
clinical systematic lectures in the medical
journals, and a small treatise on Diphtheria (1861).
His addresses to the British Medical Association
(1869), and to the Epidemiological Society (1866),
published together, are most excellent as summaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of the modern progress of medicine, and as pointing
out the directions in which future advances may be
made. He insists most strongly on and desires most
ardently the prevention of disease, and shows a striking
readiness to welcome new discoveries.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Few more striking individualities have been seen
among the provincial physicians of our day than that
of <span class="smcap">William Budd</span>, of Clifton. He was one of the
younger sons of Mr. Samuel Budd, a successful medical
practitioner at North Tawton in Devonshire, who
having very considerable culture and foresightedness,
brought up most of his large family at home, and was
ultimately enabled to introduce seven out of nine sons
to the medical profession, sending seven to Cambridge,
where five became wranglers. One of the elder
brothers, George Budd, was long Professor of Medicine
at King’s College, London, the author of an excellent
treatise on Diseases of the Liver, and a most successful
London physician. William Budd was born in
September 1811; his medical studies were pursued
in London, Edinburgh, and Paris, in the latter of which
cities he spent four years. Graduating M.D. in 1838
at Edinburgh, he for some time afterwards assisted his
father in his practice at North Tawton, and here in
1839 commenced his lifelong studies on typhoid
fever, having himself been already a sufferer by that
malady. He had peculiar advantages in this study,
for he was personally acquainted with every inhabitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
of the village, and being as medical practitioner in
almost exclusive possession of the field, nearly every
one who fell ill, not only in the village itself, but over a
large area around it, came immediately under his care.
At the date of the outbreak the population of eleven
or twelve hundred had been extremely exempt from
fevers. Yet there was no sewerage system; cesspools
prevailed; pig styes were close to the houses; and all
conditions of decomposition were to be found;—but fever
did not arise till it had been specifically introduced.
In July 1839 the first case of typhoid occurred, and
before the beginning of November over eighty of the
inhabitants had suffered from it. Young Budd kept
an accurate and detailed record of every essential fact,
and spared no pains in tracing out all extraneous facts
that he required to know. He was extremely struck by
the fact that three persons left North Tawton after they
had been infected, and all three communicated the
disease to one or more of the persons by whom they
were surrounded. The narrative which Dr. Budd gave
many years afterwards, in his “Typhoid Fever: its
Nature, Mode of Spreading, and Prevention” (1873),
is like a romance for its interesting detail, though
melancholy with its tale of pain and death. He shows
that there is evidently a specific poison which breeds
and multiplies in the living human body, and that
this process of breeding and multiplying constitutes
the fever itself. This essentially is its contagiousness,
the communication from body to body of the specific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
matter or germ, which when bred and multiplied produces
the fever. This he called the master-fact in its
history. He further believed that all the emanations
from the typhoid patient are in a certain degree
infectious, but that what is cast off from the intestine
is incomparably more virulent than anything else.
Wherever no sufficient provision was made for preventing
such material from contaminating the soil
and air of the inhabited area around, notwithstanding the
most spacious rooms, the freest ventilation, and careful
nursing, he found there was no real security against
the spread of the fever. The fact alleged against Dr.
Budd’s views, that typhoid is seldom taken by
attendants on the sick, does not at all militate against
his teaching, for unless they received into their system
through milk, water, food, or air, some of the specific
poison of typhoid, they would certainly not suffer.</p>

<p>In 1842 Dr. Budd settled in Clifton, and was in 1847
elected Physician to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He
lectured for a number of years in the Bristol Medical
School, and worked incessantly at maturing and propagating
his views on the nature and mode of propagation
of zymotic disease. He was no mere theorist, but
in all his pursuits had most practical objects in view,
seeking to enforce on his medical brethren, public
authorities as well as private persons, the urgent
necessity of the most careful, well-advised, and continuous
methods of disinfection. He was in effect a
great sanitarian and champion of preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span> medicine.
Pure water was one of his great panaceas. The Bristol
Waterworks were among his cherished objects of promotion
and watchfulness. His remarkable clearness of
vision and strength of conviction made him somewhat
impatient of the strenuous opposition with which his
views were met. For a long period he was almost
alone in his uphill fight. He did not fully put his
views before the profession till 1857-60, when he
published a series of papers in the <cite>Lancet</cite>, afterwards
embodied in his work on typhoid fever; but he had
long before taught them in the Bristol Medical School,
and practically acted upon them himself. During the
depressing period of opposition which he encountered,
almost the only sympathy he could count on was that
of the late Sir Thomas Watson, who encouraged him
greatly, believing his investigations to be of priceless
value. Cheered in this way, Budd continued to
promulgate his views, dogmatically it is true, but in
a manner singularly attractive, for he had a natural
kindliness of disposition and freedom from all jealousy.
His impressive eloquence was not more striking than
his logical power, which is evident in all his works.</p>

<p>Asiatic cholera, when it broke out in Bristol in 1866,
found William Budd and Bristol prepared. The deaths
from this destroyer in 1849 had been 1979, in 1866 they
were but 29, notwithstanding that the disease broke
out very severely, and occurred in twenty-six different
localities. Budd’s preventive measures, and his stringent
plans of disinfection, proved victorious. He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the contagious diseases of animals subjects of special
study; and his conclusion was that several of them
could only be adequately dealt with by immediately
slaughtering the infected animals. This view he took
in regard to the terrible rinderpest of 1866: and his
advice of “a poleaxe and a pit of quicklime,” though
at first ridiculed, had to be followed, after great loss
had taken place through not following it earlier.</p>

<p>Dr. Budd was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1870. Besides his famous work on typhoid fever,
and many scattered contributions to medical journals
and societies, Dr. Budd was the author of the following
works, many of which are of very great value:—“Malignant
Cholera: its Mode of Propagation and
its Prevention” (1849); “Scarlet Fever and its Prevention”
(1869); “The Siberian Cattle Plague, or the
Typhoid Fever of the Ox” (1865); “On Diseases which
affect Corresponding Parts of the Body in a Symmetrical
Manner” (1842); “Researches on Gout” (1855);
“Cholera and Disinfection, or Asiatic Cholera in Bristol
in 1866” (1871); “Variola Ovina—Sheep’s Smallpox—or
the Laws of Contagious Epidemics Illustrated by an
Experimental Type” (1863). He was an accomplished
draughtsman and an excellent photographer, and made
great use of these arts in his researches. He was well
skilled in French, German, and Italian, and kept himself
well up in Continental as well as English medical
literature. He worked with untiring energy and industry,
having a large practice extending far beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Bristol: but the attempt to combine this with so much
original research proved too much for his constitution.
He had been originally strong, but was weakened by
two attacks of fever, and finally in 1873 his health
broke down, and this led to his finally retiring from
practice and settling at Clevedon, where he died
January 9, 1880. Just previously to his retirement he
had committed to his friend Dr. Paget of Cambridge
a brief summary of the results of many years’ study
of pulmonary consumption, as to its communicability
from person to person by organic germs. This was
published in the <cite>Lancet</cite> at the time, but unfortunately
the fuller researches therein referred to have never
been given to the public. But in connection with
typhoid and other zymotic fevers he has left on the
subject the indelible impression of his great genius.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The exertions of <span class="smcap">Charles Murchison</span>, who died
before Budd, though much younger, were largely devoted
to controverting Budd’s views on the germ
theory of zymotic diseases. He belonged to the same
Aberdeenshire family from which Sir Roderick Murchison
the geologist sprang, and was born in Jamaica
in 1830. His father, himself a physician, spent his
latter days in Elgin, where his son Charles was at first
educated. As early as 1845 he entered Aberdeen
University, but in 1847-8 he commenced medical study
at Edinburgh, and in successive years gained numerous
distinctions and considerable note as a diligent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
successful student. In 1850 he was Syme’s house-surgeon.
In August 1857, when he graduated, he
received the gold medal for his thesis on the Pathology
of Morbid Growths. He further studied at the Rotunda,
Dublin, and in Paris, whence he went to India, being
appointed Professor of Chemistry to the Medical
College, Calcutta. In this office he was both successful
as an experimenter and as an expositor. Later, he
went with the army on the British Expedition against
Burmah, and utilised the opportunity to make valuable
observations on the climate and diseases of Burmah,
which he afterwards published.</p>

<p>Returning to England in 1855, Murchison became
a member of the London College of Physicians,
Physician to the Westminster General Dispensary, and
Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. Mary’s Hospital. In
1856 he was appointed Assistant-Physician to King’s
College Hospital, which office he resigned in 1860,
and joined the staff of the Middlesex Hospital. He
further held from 1856 the post of Assistant-Physician
to the London Fever Hospital, steadily pursuing there
as elsewhere his investigations into the nature and
causes of zymotic diseases, from which he himself twice
suffered in the form of typhus fever, which left in him
heart-mischief that ultimately caused his death.</p>

<p>In 1862 appeared Murchison’s work on “The Continued
Fevers of Great Britain,” dealing especially with
typhus, typhoid, and relapsing fevers. In this he
treats exhaustively the history, geographical range,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
causation, symptoms, treatment, and many other questions
connected with fevers, and endeavours especially
to reduce his observations to a numerical expression.
His strong conviction was that these diseases are preventable,
and that they originate in certain unhealthy
and impure conditions capable of generating specific
poisons in each case. But as he commenced his work
at the London Fever Hospital believing that typhus
and typhoid fever were mere varieties of one disease,
in spite of Stewart’s and Jenner’s publications, so he
maintained to the last that Budd’s view as to the
germ origin of typhoid fever was erroneous, and that
even if typhoid were communicable by germs, it could
arise anew when favouring conditions of decomposition
occurred. He regarded it as proved that typhoid fever
is constantly appearing where decomposing sewage is
present, but where every effort fails to detect contamination
from a previous typhoid patient.</p>

<p>Murchison’s work was at once recognised as a standard
one. The first edition was rapidly sold, and it was
translated into German. The publication of a second
edition was, however, delayed till 1873, owing to Murchison’s
strong desire to make his book as complete
statistically as possible. The first edition was based on
6703 cases of continued fever admitted into the London
Fever Hospital in the years 1848-57, but the second
included the results of a far larger number, 28,863,
admitted during 1848-70, thus giving the entire medical
history of the fever hospital from the time that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
different continued fevers were first distinguished in
1848. Energy and resolution of the most intense description
are indicated by such a labour. This work
had to be done in the intervals of growing practice and
hospital teaching. By the time he was forty years old
Murchison was one of the leading London physicians,
and continued in full work till his death.</p>

<p>It was not only in regard to fevers that Murchison
held a conspicuous place and published works of great
value. In 1868 he published an excellent series of
“Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver,” which
reached a second edition in 1877, when he added to them
the Croonian Lectures on “Functional Derangements of
the Liver,” delivered at the College of Physicians in
1874. In 1871, when St. Thomas’s new hospital
was opened, Murchison was invited to join its staff
as full physician and joint-lecturer on medicine.
In this growing school he found full scope for his great
talent as a clinical teacher. Of his success in this
capacity the <cite>Lancet</cite> said<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—“His teaching was a reflex of
his singular lucidity of thought and expression, which
not only attracted the student with its distinctness and
brilliancy, but furnished him with a method on which
to found his own facts and observations.” His inaugural
address as President of the Pathological Society in 1877
gave further proof of his marked originality of thought.</p>

<p>Murchison’s accomplishments and personal attractiveness
were as remarkable as his professional talents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>and industry. In botany, zoology, chemistry, and geology
he had very wide knowledge, and he edited the
palæontological memoirs of his friend Hugh Falconer,
the explorer of the Miocene fauna of the Siwalik
Hills. Fly-fishing was his favourite recreation. “In
personal appearance,” says the <cite>Lancet</cite>, “Dr. Murchison
was slightly below middle stature, and before the commencement
of his fatal illness, of sturdy robust build,
with the appearance of one well fitted to bear the trials
and struggles of life. His head was large, the forehead
high and full, the hair black, and eyes of surprising
brilliancy and power of expression. In manner he was
reserved, sparing of speech, and free from that impulsiveness
which hails the ordinary acquaintances of life
as esteemed friends. To those who knew him intimately,
however, his full character was revealed, and they found
in him a depth of love, tenderness, and sympathy,
together with a constancy and devotion in friendship,
rarely found in more demonstrative natures.” He
attached himself particularly to the younger members
of his profession, and never spared time or trouble in
assisting them with his counsel and sympathy. He
suffered severely from heart disease for several years
before his death, which took place suddenly in the
interval between the departure of one patient and the
announcement of another, on the 23d April 1879.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR JOSEPH LISTER AND ANTISEPTIC SURGERY.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Again</span> and again in these pages the hereditary
succession of scientific powers has been illustrated.
Not the least eminent example is to be found in the
case of Sir Joseph Lister, who is the son of Mr. Joseph
Jackson Lister, F.R.S., of Upton House, Essex, who in
the words of the Rev. J. B. Reade, F.R.S., in his presidential
address to the Royal Microscopical Society
in 1870, “raised the compound microscope from its
primitive and almost useless condition to that of being
the most important instrument ever yet bestowed by
art upon the investigator of nature.” Mr. J. J. Lister
was born in London on January 11, 1786, his parents
being members of the Society of Friends. At fourteen
years of age he left school to assist his father in the
wine trade: but though for many years closely occupied
in business, he contrived by early rising and otherwise
to supplement his plain school education, and to make
himself accomplished in mathematics, as well as generally
acquainted with most subjects in literature,
science, and art. His predilection for optics was early
shown. As a little child with shortsighted eyes, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
enjoyed looking through air bubbles in the window-pane,
enabling him to see distant objects more clearly.
At school he was the only boy who possessed a telescope.
He soon became addicted to microscopical
study; but it was not till 1824, when he was 38 years
old, that he thought of improving the object-glass of
the compound microscope, and made suggestions to
W. Tulley, the optician, which resulted in the production
of a new object-glass much less thick and
clumsy, which speedily became the favourite. On
January 21st, 1830, he read a paper before the Royal
Society “On the Improvement of Compound Microscopes,”
announcing the remarkable discovery of the
existence of two aplanatic foci in a double achromatic
object-glass. This formed a basis for subsequent important
improvements. In 1837 he gave to Andrew
Ross the construction for a ⅛-inch objective of three
compound lenses, by which that maker’s fame was
largely increased, and it became the standard form for
high power for many years. He also made some
notable researches “On the Structure and Functions of
Tubular Polypi and Ascidiæ” (Phil. Trans. 1834), and
independently came to the same conclusions as Sir
George Airy, the late Astronomer-Royal, on the limits
of human vision as determined by the nature of light
and of the eye; but his paper on this subject was never
published, owing to the publication of Sir George Airy’s
researches. He survived in vigorous health to see his
son Joseph in secure possession of fame, dying on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
October 24, 1869. His son records<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that “he was most
unselfish, and scrupulously tender of hurting the feelings
of others, and extremely generous in the pecuniary
support of public philanthropic objects, as well as in
secret acts of charity. Though warmly attached to
the religious Society of Friends, to which he belonged,
he was a man of very liberal views and catholic
sympathies. But the crowning grace of this beautiful
character, though it might veil his rich gifts from
those not intimate with him, was a most rare modesty
and Christian humility.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Lister</span> was born in 1828, and took the B.A.
degree at London University in 1847. Pursuing a
course of medical study at University College, London,
he gained the M.B. degree in 1852, being awarded gold
medals in anatomy and in botany at the first M.B.
examination, and the scholarship and gold medal in
surgery at the final examination. He became Fellow
of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852, and took a
similar qualification at Edinburgh in 1855. He married
a daughter of Mr. Syme, then Professor of Surgery in
the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Dovoting">Devoting</ins> himself to physiological research on matters
having a wide bearing on practical medicine and surgery,
Mr. Lister attained wide repute as an original investigator
at a comparatively early age, and his position in
physiology was assured by a series of papers which
would suffice to make his career memorable, if he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>never applied antiseptic measures to the treatment of
disease. Beginning with some observations on the
contractile tissue of the iris in 1853, he went on to
study the muscular tissue of the skin, the flow of the
lacteal fluid, and the minute structure of involuntary
muscular fibre, on all of which subjects his papers are
published in the “Journal of Microscopical Science.”
In 1857 he commenced his series of contributions to
the Royal Society, the first being on the functions of
the visceral nerves, with special reference to the inhibitory
system. This was further developed in “An
Inquiry regarding the Parts of the Nervous System
which regulate the Contractions of the Arteries” (Phil.
Trans. 1858). But his two most important papers at
this period are those on the Early Stages of Inflammation
(1857), and on the Coagulation of the Blood,
delivered as the Croonian Lecture for 1863.</p>

<p>For some years Mr. Lister was a lecturer on surgery
in the Edinburgh Extra-Academical School. He was
afterwards elected Professor of Surgery in Glasgow
University, and Surgeon to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.</p>

<p>While Mr. Lister held these appointments, circumstances
occurred which were calculated to stimulate
to the highest degree the effort to discover some
method of dressing wounds which should obviate the
dangers of putrefactive changes. About 1860 a new
surgical hospital was erected as part of this infirmary,
and although many of the most approved principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of hospital construction had been adopted, the building
proved extremely unhealthy. Pyæmia, erysipelas,
and hospital gangrene soon showed themselves, affecting
on the average most severely those parts of the
building nearest to the ground. For several years
Mr. Lister found that in his male accident ward,
which was on the ground-floor, when nearly all the
beds contained patients with open sores, the diseases
which result from hospital atmosphere were sure to
be present in an aggravated form; whereas, when a
large proportion of the cases had no external wound,
these evils were greatly mitigated or entirely absent.
At this period the managers were very desirous of
introducing additional beds into the wards, to supply
accommodation for the rapidly increasing population
of Glasgow; and Mr. Lister strongly and firmly resisted
such increase in his wards. Some of the wards
indeed at times became subject to such severe mortality
that they had to be closed for various periods. One
particular visitation was so serious that it was resolved
to make an investigation to discover if possible
the cause of the evil, which might, one would think,
have been done at an earlier period. Great was the
shock of every one concerned to find that a few inches
below the surface of the ground behind the two
lowest male accident wards, with only the basement
area, four feet wide, intervening, there was the
uppermost tier of a multitude of coffins, which had
been placed there at the time of the cholera epidemic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
of 1849. The corpses had undergone so little change
in the interval that the clothes they had on at the
time of their hurried burial were plainly distinguishable.
The wonder was, not that these wards on the
ground-floor had been unhealthy, but that they had
not been absolutely pestilential. Yet at the very
time when this shocking disclosure was made, Mr.
Lister was able to state, in an address which he
delivered to the British Medical Association at Dublin
in 1867, that during the previous nine months, in
which his new antiseptic plans of treatment had
been in operation in his wards, not a single case of
pyæmia, erysipelas, or hospital gangrene had occurred
in them.</p>

<p>The managers of the infirmary of course did all
in their power to remedy this insalubrious state of
things. They poured large quantities of carbolic acid
and quicklime upon the ground, considering this a less
dangerous proceeding than to attempt the removal of
the putrefying mass; they covered the ground with
an additional thickness of earth, and adopted other
measures. The hospital itself was far from being well
situated in other respects. It abutted against the
old Cathedral Churchyard, much used for the “pit
burial” of paupers in a most deleterious state of
aggregation. Yet during the two years and a quarter
intervening between the Dublin address and Mr.
Lister’s leaving Glasgow for Edinburgh, his new antiseptic
system continued in the main as successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
as before.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1864 Professor Lister had
been much struck with an account of the remarkable
effects produced by carbolic acid upon the sewage of
the town of Carlisle, the admixture of a very small
proportion not only preventing all odour from the
lands irrigated with the refuse material, but also
destroying the entozoa which usually infest cattle fed
upon such pastures. His attention having been for
several years greatly directed, as we have seen above,
to the subject of suppuration, especially in its relation
to decomposition, he saw that such a powerful antiseptic
was peculiarly adapted for experiments with a
view to elucidating that subject, and thus the applicability
of carbolic acid to the treatment of compound
fractures occurred to him.</p>

<p>The antiseptic system was put into practice in the
Glasgow Infirmary in March 1865, but at first applied
almost exclusively in compound fractures (or those in
which there is an external wound) and abscesses.
From 1867 it was employed for almost all surgical
cases. It arose out of Mr. Lister’s study of Schwann
and Pasteur’s germ theory and the experiments connected
with them. He repeated many of the experiments,
and devised new methods calculated to test
whether they were capable of explaining the phenomena
of putrefaction. These sufficed to prove
definitely that in putrefaction the development of such
organisms as the microscope could detect, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
concomitant putrefactive changes, were occasioned by
minute germs suspended in the atmosphere. Professor
Tyndall’s beautiful experiments, by which he demonstrated
the perfect manner in which cotton wool filters
the air of its suspended particles, led to the idea
(suggested by Dr. Meredith of the Indian service to
Mr. Lister) that cotton wool might be used with
advantage as an antiseptic dressing. The cotton wool
must itself be rendered pure of germs by some antiseptic
agency, for by the theory the air within it must
contain germs. But the main feature upon which Mr.
Lister for a long time relied was the copious use of
carbolic acid in such a form as to prevent the occurrence
of putrefaction in the part concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Lister’s first paper on the subject, published in
the <cite>Lancet</cite> for 1867, struck a chord which the editor of
that journal emphasised as follows on August 24 of
that year (p. 234): “If Professor Lister’s conclusions
with regard to the power of carbolic acid in compound
fractures should be confirmed by further experiment
and observation, it will be difficult to overrate the
importance of what we may really call his discovery.
For although he bases his surgical use of carbolic acid
upon the researches of M. Pasteur, the application of
these researches to the case of compound fractures,
opened abscesses, and other recent wounds, is all his
own.” The risk of blood-poisoning after operations in
themselves slight, was declared to be the one great
opprobrium of surgery. There was no limit to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
operative skill of surgeons, but a miserable and serious
risk of fatal after-consequences against which the
surgeon had no defence. Mr. (now Sir James) Paget
had in 1862 given forth an idea of which we can now
more clearly see the bearing, when he said that the
best results he had seen in cases of pyæmia were with
patients kept night and day in a current of wind. We
now see that this in fact amounted to continually
passing over the patient air less charged with germs
than that of the room or ward in which he was placed.
Mr. Lister contemplated the destruction of these germs
at the seat of the wound, and the prevention of the
access of fresh germs.</p>

<p>An example will perhaps illustrate the matter better
than a theoretical account. An experiment was performed
on the 31st December 1868 on a young calf a
few days old, under chloroform, namely, the tying of the
carotid artery on the antiseptic system, with threads
composed of animal tissue. The threads employed had
all been soaked for four hours in a saturated watery
solution of carbolic acid, which swelled and softened
them. The hair near the wound was cut short, and a
solution of carbolic acid in linseed oil rubbed well into
the skin to destroy any putrefactive organisms lying
amongst the roots of the hair. The sponges employed
in the operation were wrung out of a watery solution
of the acid, and all the instruments introduced into the
wound, together with the fingers of the operator’s left
hand and the copper wire used for sutures, were treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
with the same lotion, some of which was poured into
the wound after the introduction of the last stitch, at
one of the intervals left for the escape of discharge, to
provide against the chance of any fresh blood which
might have oozed out during the process of stitching
having passed back and taken fresh germs in with it.
The external dressing was a towel saturated with the
oily solution of carbolic acid, folded as broad as the
length of the neck, wrapped so as to extend freely
beyond the wound, and prevented by several contrivances
from slipping. A sheet of gutta-percha
tissue was applied outside to prevent contamination of
the antiseptic towel from without. A few ounces of
the oily solution were poured daily over the towel for
the first week, after which the dressings were left
untouched for three days and then entirely removed.
The wound was found quite dry, and free from tenderness.
When the animal was subsequently killed, the
ligatures were seen to be converted into living tissue;
and such experiments proved how valuable animal
fibres might be as ligatures under the antiseptic
system.</p>

<p>Again, a portion of cotton wool was impregnated
with about one two-hundredth part of its weight of
carbolic-acid vapour, and the surface of a granulating
sore and surrounding skin was washed with a dilute
solution of the acid. A piece of oiled silk of the size
of the sore was then applied, to prevent the dressings
from sticking through becoming dry. Over this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
placed a piece of folded linen rag of rather larger size,
and similarly impregnated with carbolic acid vapour to
the cotton wool; this being intended to absorb any
discharge from the sore. Lastly, an overlapping mass
of carbolised cotton wool was securely fixed over all.
The result was that although all chemical antiseptic
virtue left the dressing by evaporation of the volatile
carbolic acid in a day or two, yet putrefaction was
practically excluded by the cotton wool for any length
of time.</p>

<p>Subsequently another variety of protective material
was adopted, namely antiseptic gauze, a loose cotton
fabric, the fibres of which were impregnated with
carbolic acid lodged in insoluble resin. The interstices
between the fibres were kept free from these ingredients,
so that the porous fabric might readily absorb discharges.
By arranging this in a sufficient number of
layers and covering the whole with a layer of mackintosh,
the discharge was compelled to pass through the
whole length of the antiseptic dressing. Thus it was
almost certain that if no putrefactive mischief were
left in a wound or abscess, none would enter it, however
profuse might be the discharge.</p>

<p>If a wound was presented for treatment, inflicted by
some other than the surgeon, some dust was sure to
have been introduced, which probably contained putrefactive
germs. The energy of these had first to be
destroyed by washing the raw surface with some strong
antiseptic agent. But in operating upon a previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
unbroken skin, Mr. Lister considered that he could
prevent the septic particles from entering at all, by
operating in an antiseptic atmosphere. This was provided
by producing a shower of spray of carbolic acid of
the finest character. This answered exceedingly well
when the solution producing the spray consisted only of
one part of carbolic acid to 100 parts of water.</p>

<p>Here we must limit our detailed account of the
antiseptic system. Under it large abscesses are opened,
the matter pressed out, and fresh matter does not form,
and cures are effected in severe cases which scarcely
ever used to be cured. Arteries are tied with a security
before unknown. Amputations and excisions are
effected with a safety and diminished mortality quite
surprising. Even senile gangrene shows hopeful
results which were previously quite out of question.
Pyæmia, hospital gangrene, and erysipelas have been
almost banished from wards where the system is
properly carried out. Recently a modification has been
introduced, in which there is employed, not a volatile
material as in the case of carbolic acid, but a dilute
solution of corrosive sublimate combined with albumen.
Gauze is now prepared for Sir Joseph Lister steeped in
this substance, and it may become generally adopted;
but it does not appear likely to supersede carbolic acid
for the purification of instruments, sponges, the skin,
or as a substitute for the carbolic spray. The particular
form of antiseptic is a matter of detail, on which
improvement may long continue to be made; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
development of the essential idea of preventing the
access of germs which can cause putrefactive changes
by one method or another, and the destruction of them
as far as possible when they have obtained access, will
remain connected with Sir Joseph Lister as an achievement
of the highest force; indeed his name seems
likely to give a new word to our language, namely
Listerism, by which the essential features of his system
are understood.</p>

<p>Professor Lister was awarded a Royal Medal by the
Royal Society of London in 1880, having previously
received the high distinction of the MacDougall Brisbane
Prize from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
1875, for a remarkable paper on the Germ Theory of
Fermentative Changes. He was created a baronet in
December 1883. The universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh,
and Glasgow had conferred upon him the
honorary degree of LL.D., and Oxford that of D.C.L.
He has been for some years Surgeon to King’s College
Hospital, having succeeded Sir William Fergusson.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR THOMAS WATSON, SIR DOMINIC CORRIGAN, SIR
WILLIAM GULL, AND CLINICAL MEDICINE.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Nestor of the medical profession, Sir Thomas
Watson, died in 1882, at the great age of ninety,
universally beloved and honoured. Yet he had written
but one extended work, the “Lectures on the Principles
and Practice of Physic,” and had made no striking
discovery. But to have written a book which every
cultivated practitioner reads, and reads with delight
and satisfaction, is an achievement given to few, many
though there be who aim at it. And Sir Thomas
Watson’s personal character was as unique as his
advice was valuable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Watson</span> was born on March 7th, 1792, at
Montrath (now Dulford) House, near Cullompton,
Devonshire, where his father, Joseph Watson, a Northumbrian
by family, was then living. He was
educated at Bury St. Edmund’s Grammar School,
where he was a schoolfellow with Blomfield, afterwards
Bishop of London, and a great friend of Watson’s.
In 1811 he entered at St. John’s College,
Cambridge, and became tenth wrangler and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>fellow of
his college. At that time only two fellows of St.
John’s could retain their fellowships without taking
orders, and one of these must study medicine. This
circumstance availed to turn Watson’s attention to
medicine in 1819 at the age of 27, when he entered
St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and came under the
powerful influence of Abernethy. During the session
1820-1 he attended medical lectures at Edinburgh
University, and in 1822 received his licence to practise
from Cambridge. But academical pursuits were continued,
and Watson took private pupils, among whom
was Lord Auckland, afterwards Bishop of Bath and
Wells, and served the office of proctor in 1823-4. In
1825 he took his M.D. degree, and married Miss Jones,
niece of Turner, Dean of Norwich and Master of
Pembroke College. Soon afterwards he established
himself as a physician in Henrietta Street, Cavendish
Square, London, in which street he continued to live
for fifty-seven years. His wife died, to his lasting
regret, five years later, leaving him with one son and
daughter, to whom he was devotedly attached.</p>

<p>Watson was recognised from the commencement of
his London career as a man of mark, and in 1827 he
was elected Physician to the Middlesex Hospital. In
1828, on the opening of the University College, he was
appointed Professor of Clinical Medicine, retaining his
post at the Middlesex Hospital; but he transferred his
services as lecturer to King’s College in 1831, becoming
Professor of Forensic Medicine. Practice had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
but slowly in these years. In 1831 he made his first
contribution to medical literature, in the shape of
“Remarks on the Dissection of Bishop, and the Phenomena
attending Death by Strangulation” (<cite>Medical
Gazette</cite>). Bishop had murdered an Italian organ-boy,
and brought the body to King’s College for sale:
Bishop was hanged, and his body, like that of his victim,
came to King’s College for dissection. From this
time Dr. Watson made numerous contributions to the
<cite>Medical Gazette</cite>, largely embodied in his subsequent
great work. In July 1832 he was chosen to accompany
Sir Walter Scott from London to Edinburgh
when he was returning from Italy to Abbotsford for
the last time.</p>

<p>In 1836 Dr. Watson was appointed to the chair of
the Principles and Practice of Medicine at King’s
College, and in the ensuing winter delivered the first
draught of those lectures on which his fame rests.
They soon became well known, and they were printed
weekly in the <cite>Medical Gazette</cite> in 1840-2. Finally
they were published in two volumes by Parker in 1844,
and became acknowledged as medical classics. Mr.
Parker showed a righteous liberality when their great
sale had brought in a large sum, in granting the author
two-thirds of the profits instead of one-half, as had
been agreed, and handing him twelve hundred pounds
as a first payment. Watson had already, in 1840, resigned
his chair at King’s College rather than leave his old
post at Middlesex Hospital, but in 1843 he was compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
by the increase of private practice to resign
even this. Henceforward, especially after the retirement
of Dr. Chambers in 1848, he was at the head of
London practice for many years. He was not, however,
appointed one of the Queen’s Physicians-Extraordinary
till 1859; in 1861 he was called in to attend
the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Physician Consort">Prince-Consort</ins> in his fatal illness, and in 1866 he
was created a baronet, receiving in 1870 the further
appointment of Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen.
The College of Physicians elected him President in
1862, an office he held for five years. From 1858 to
1860 he represented the College on the General Medical
Council. In 1857-8 he was President of the Pathological
Society, and he was in 1868 the first President
of the Clinical Society. In 1859 he was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Two quotations from Watson’s Introductory Lecture
to his course will serve to indicate some of the qualities
which have given his book such popularity.
Referring to the study of anatomy and physiology,
he says; “Do not think that I am wandering from my
proper subject when I bid you to remember how profoundly
interesting, how almost awful, is the study in
itself and for its own sake, revealing, as it surely does,
the inimitable workmanship of a Hand that is Divine.
Do not lose or disregard that grand and astonishing
lesson. Do not listen to those who may tell you not
to look for the evidence of purpose in this field of
study, that the visible mechanism of that intricate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>but
marvellously perfect and harmonious work, the animal
body—the numberless examples of means suited to
ends, of fitness for a use, of even prospective arrangements
to meet future needs, of direct provisions for happiness
and enjoyment—that all these have no force at
all, in true philosophy, as evidences of design. For my
own part, I declare that I can no more avoid perceiving,
with my mental vision, the evidential marks of purpose
in the structure of the body, than I can help
seeing with my open eyes, in broad daylight, the
objects that stand before my face.”</p>

<p>Again, he characterises the profession of medicine in
noble terms. “The profession of medicine having for
its end the common good of mankind, knows nothing of
national enmities, of political strife, of sectarian divisions.
Disease and pain the sole conditions of its
ministry, it is disquieted by no misgivings about the
justice or the honesty of its client’s cause; but dispenses
its peculiar benefits, without stint or scruple,
to men of every country or party, and rank and religion,
and to men of no religion at all. And like the quality
of mercy, of which it is the favourite handmaid, it
“blesses him that gives and him that takes,” reading
continually to our own hearts and understandings the
most impressive lessons, the most solemn warnings.
It is ours to know in how many instances, forming
indeed a vast majority of the whole, bodily suffering
and sickness are the natural fruits of evil courses—of
the sins of our fathers, of our own unbridled passions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
of the malevolent spirit of others. We see, too, the
uses of these judgments, which are mercifully designed
to recall men from the strong allurements of sense, and
the slumber of temporal prosperity, teaching that it is
good for us to be sometimes afflicted. Familiar with
death in its manifold shapes, witnessing from day to
day its sudden stroke, its slow but open siege, its secret
and insidious approaches, we are not permitted to be
unmindful that our own stay also is brief and uncertain,
our opportunities fleeting, and our time, even when
longest, very short, if measured by our moral wants
and intellectual cravings.”</p>

<p>These lectures had the largest sale of any similar
work in the author’s lifetime. Five large editions were
published under his own revision. He most unsparingly
altered his previous views with the advance of science,
and showed rare modesty in his expressions thereupon.
Dr. Charles West has admirably sketched his friend’s
character (<cite>Medical Times and Gazette</cite>, Dec. 16, 1882):
“He laid no claim to genius; he made no great discovery.
Though a scholar he was not more learned,
though a good speaker he was not more eloquent, than
many of his contemporaries whose names are now well-nigh
forgotten; and yet he was by universal consent
regarded as the completest illustration of the highest
type of the physician. His moral as well as his intellectual
qualities had much to do with the estimate
which all formed of his character. His faculties were
remarkably well balanced, his mind was eminently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
fair. He had that gift—the attribute and the reward
of truth—the power intuitively to detect all specious
error. Hence, while the added experience of each year
gave increased value to his teachings and his writings,
it brought but little for him to unlearn or to unsay.
He took a wide view of every question.... He availed
himself of knowledge from all sources, and for all purposes
except vain display; he used theories to illustrate
his facts and to point their meaning, but no further,
conscious that, with imperfect knowledge, it would be
idle to attempt to build up correct theory.... Take
him in his teaching, all in all, he seems to me, more
than any one I ever knew, to be the undoubted heir
of England’s greatest practical physician, Thomas
Sydenham.”</p>

<p>Another writer in the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>, Dec.
23, 1882, speaks of his serene and gentle temper, his
modest dignity, his benevolent kindness, his unfailing
clearness of judgment. “Nothing that happened in the
professional world, of human or scientific importance,
was alien to him; and there are few men among his
contemporaries who have not at one time or another
come to him for advice and guidance. Conciliatory to
the utmost bounds of kindness, he was never open to
the charge of favouring compromise.... It is rare
indeed to find any man of whom it may be said as of
him, that there is not one man in the profession who
would at any time have declined to accept Sir Thomas
Watson’s judgment on any personal or professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
question as final. His sense of justice, his habitual
reference of all questions of detail to unassailable principle,
his flexibility of mind, and his quick perception
of character, gave him a rare but well-justified ascendancy
over even the ablest of his contemporaries.”
After a long old age spent in retirement from practice,
but in continued vigorous professional study, of which
he gave evidence in a little book on the Abolition of
Zymotic Diseases, published as late as 1879, the venerable
man died of old age at his son’s residence at
Reigate, in Surrey, on December 11, 1882.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Born about ten years after the last-mentioned
eminent physician, <span class="smcap">Dominic John Corrigan</span> for many
years held a position in Dublin somewhat parallel to
that of Watson in London. He was a native of Dublin,
born on December 1st, 1802, his father having been a
merchant in Thomas Street. Educated first at the lay
college of St. Patrick’s at Maynooth, he entered upon
medical study as the pupil of Dr. O’Kelly of Maynooth,
who had foresight to discern that his pupil was capable
of rising to the highest position in the profession, and
advised his being sent to the Edinburgh Medical School.
Part of his medical study was, however, pursued in
Dublin, where he attended clinical lectures at Sir
Patrick Dun’s Hospital. His Edinburgh degree dates
from 1825.</p>

<p>The rising science of pathology had deeply impressed
young Corrigan’s mind, and he devoted himself, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
settling in Dublin as physician to the Meath Street
Dispensary, to original study. One of the principal
fruits of his inquiries was his classic paper on “Permanent
Patency of the Mouth of the Aorta, or
Inadequacy of the Aortic Valves,” published in the
<cite>Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</cite>, April 1832.
This paper commenced with the following statement,
“The disease to which the above name is given has
not, so far as I am aware, been described in any of the
works on diseases of the heart. The object of the
present paper is to supply that deficiency. The disease
is not uncommon. It supplies a considerable proportion
of cases of deranged action of the heart, and it
deserves attention from its peculiar signs, its progress,
and its treatment. The pathological essence of the
disease consists in inefficiency of the valvular apparatus
at the mouth of the aorta, in consequence of which the
blood sent into the mouth regurgitates into the ventricle.
This regurgitation, and the signs by which it is denoted,
are not necessarily connected with one particular change
of structure in the valvular apparatus.” One particular
feature attending these cases, which Corrigan was the
first fully to describe, was the extraordinary character
of the pulse, since known very generally as “Corrigan’s
pulse.” The strong visible pulsation in the arteries of
the head, neck, and arms, bounding into a new position
with each beat of the heart, and becoming prominent
under the skin, has since proved the means whereby
aortic valvular disease of the heart has been recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
in multitudes of cases. The full pulse, followed by
almost complete collapse, has since been termed “jerking,
splashing, or collapsing,” or the “water-hammer
pulse.” The peculiar rushing thrill felt by the finger
in the large superior arteries was also dwelt upon, as
well as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“bruit de souffle”</span> heard as an accompaniment
of the heart-sounds. Corrigan had corrected
Laennec’s erroneous view of the cause of this bruit, in a
previous paper in the <cite>Lancet</cite> of vol. ii., 1829, p. 1.</p>

<p>Dr. Corrigan continued for some years zealously to
investigate the functions of the heart, and he experimented
largely upon the hearts of fishes and reptiles.
He published an important paper “On the Motions
and Sounds of the Heart,” in the <cite>Dublin Medical
Transactions</cite>, 1830, part i. At this period of his
career, when practice as yet was but scanty, he was
much encouraged by reading “The Lives of British
Physicians, from Linacre to Gooch,” published in 1830,
and he referred to it afterwards as showing that “there
is but one road to excellence and success in our profession,
and that is by steady study and hard labour;
and you will at least always have this consolation in
your dreariest hour of labour, that no proud man’s
contumely, no insolence of office, nor ‘spurns that
patient merit of the unworthy takes,’ can bar your
way.”</p>

<p>Resigning his post at the Meath Street Dispensary,
Corrigan became successively attached to the Cork
Street Fever Hospital, and to the Jervis Street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Hospital. Yet the Irish College of Physicians failed to
discern his great merits, and blackballed him when he
was first proposed for the fellowship, a mistake which
they subsequently atoned for in some measure by
electing him their president for five successive years,
and by commissioning a statue of him, by Foley, at the
conclusion of his term of office. In 1833 he began to
lecture on the practice of medicine in the Carmichael
School of Medicine, and practice grew rapidly. In 1840
he was appointed physician to the House of Industry
Hospitals, which post he held till 1866. Here he
delivered a noteworthy course of lectures on the
Nature and Treatment of Fever, which were published
in 1853. He accepted and enforced the modern
views as to the distinctness of typhoid from typhus
fever.</p>

<p>In 1841 Dr. Corrigan became a member of the
Senate of the new Queen’s University, of which after
thirty years he was appointed Vice-Chancellor. In 1849
Dublin University gave him the honorary M.D. He
was assiduously devoted to the onerous duties of a Commissionership
of National Education. As to practice,
he became the most popular and highly remunerated
physician Dublin had ever seen, having for many
years more calls upon him than he could possibly
attend to, and receiving in several years as much as
£9000 per annum in fees. In 1866 he was made a
baronet in consideration both of his medical position
and of his important services to national education.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
He was also Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen in
Ireland.</p>

<p>As member of the General Medical Council from
1858 till his death, Sir Dominic Corrigan exercised a
strong influence in favour of elevating the standard of
professional education. He was an eloquent and lively
debater and not at all averse to a display of verbal
pugnacity, but he was much and generally beloved.
In 1868 Sir Dominic was induced to come forward as
an advanced Liberal candidate for the representation
of the city of Dublin in Parliament; but on that
occasion, however, he was defeated. In 1870 he was
elected by a majority of over a thousand votes, and sat
in Parliament till 1874. Originally of a fine constitution,
he suffered severely from gout in his later years,
and died after an attack of paralysis on Feb. 1, 1880.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The succession of clinical physicians is well sustained
at the present day in the person of Sir <span class="smcap">William
Withey Gull</span>, Baronet. Born on the last day of
December 1816, at Thorpe-le-soken, Essex, William
Gull was educated privately, and early became a
student of Guy’s Hospital, London. To this establishment
he was so attached that for fifteen years he
resided within its walls or immediately adjacent. In
1841 he became M.B. of London University, and in
1846 M.D. He was elected Fellow of the College of
Physicians in 1846, and Fullerian Professor of Physiology
at the Royal Institution in 1847, which office he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
held till 1849.</p>

<p>Very early after his graduation as M.B., Dr. Gull
was appointed to assist the pupils at Guy’s in their
studies, or in other words, he became medical tutor.
In 1843 he began to lecture on natural philosophy.
In 1846 he undertook the important lectureships of
physiology and comparative anatomy in Guy’s Medical
School. Meanwhile about 1843 Dr. Gull had been
appointed resident superintendent of the asylum for
twenty female lunatics which Guy had ordered to be
maintained. He formed a close acquaintance with Dr.
Conolly, whose name will ever be connected with the
rational treatment of the insane in this country, and
by adopting improved methods Dr. Gull was finally so
successful that the patients were all discharged cured,
and the wards occupied by them devoted to the treatment
of acute cases more properly coming under care
in a general hospital. Meanwhile Dr. Gull was
appointed assistant-physician to Guy’s, and in due
course succeeded to the full physiciancy. In this
capacity his clinical teaching was long one of the
important features at Guy’s. In 1856 he became joint-lecturer
on medicine, which office he held till 1867
with great distinction. At this date he was compelled
by the increasing claims of practice to resign his
appointment; but he is still attached to Guy’s as
consulting physician.</p>

<p>Practice, indeed, came upon Dr. Gull all too soon for
medical science to reap the highest advantage from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
original research. But whatever he has written has
been of high value and worthy of deep consideration.
Among his writings may be mentioned the Gulstonian
Lectures on Paralysis (<cite>Medical Gazette</cite>, 1849), essays on
Hypochondriasis and Abscess of the Brain, in Reynolds’
“System of Medicine,” and Guy’s Hospital Reports,
1857; on Paraplegia, in Guy’s Hospital Reports for
1856, 1858, and 1861; on Anorexia Nervosa, and
on a Cretinoid State, in the <cite>Transactions of the Clinical
Society</cite>, vol. vii. His Report on Cholera, with Dr.
Baly, for the College of Physicians (1854), and his
paper, with Dr. Sutton, on Arterio-Capillary Fibrosis
(<cite>Med. Chir. Transactions</cite>, vol. lv.), rank high as original
contributions, which must always be consulted by writers
on those subjects.</p>

<p>In an oration delivered before the Hunterian Society
in 1861 Dr. Gull took occasion to utter a protest
against the popular prejudice for specialists. “Who
can treat as a speciality,” he asks, “the derangements
and diseases of the stomach, whilst its relations and
sympathies are so universal? How can there be a
special ‘brain doctor,’ whilst the functions of the brain
are so dependent upon parts the most distant, and
influences the most various? A tumour in the brain
may tell of its presence only through disturbance in
the stomach, and a disorder of the stomach and its
appendages may have for its most prominent symptoms
only various disturbances of the brain.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>
<p>In his address on “Clinical Observation in Relation
to Medicine,” before the British Medical Association in
1868, Dr. Gull thus expressed his impartial attitude in
medicine: “We have no system to satisfy; no dogmatic
opinions to enforce. We have no ignorance to
cloak, for we confess it.” “Medicine is a specialism;
but of no narrow kind. We have to dissect nature;
which, for practice, is better than to abstract it.” “To
clinical medicine the body becomes a pathological
museum. In every part we recognise certain proclivities
to morbid action; and the purpose of our
study is to trace these tendencies to their source on the
one hand, and to their effects on the other.” “The
effects of disease may be for a third or fourth generation,
but the laws of health are for a thousand.”
“Happily, at this day, hygiene has gained strength
enough to maintain an independent position in science.
To know and counteract the causes of disease before
they become effective is evidently the triumph of our
art; but it will be long before mankind will be wise
enough to accept the aid we could give them in this
direction. Ignorance of the laws of health, and intemperance
of all kinds, are too powerful for us. Still we
shall continue to wage an undying crusade; and truly
we may congratulate ourselves that no crusade ever
called forth more able and devoted warriors than are
thus engaged.”</p>

<p>In 1870 Dr. Gull delivered the Harveian Oration
before the Royal College of Physicians, and expressed
himself forcibly as to the duty of preventing disease.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Indeed, it is a strong article of faith with him that at
some future time the office of the physician will be
gone. “I cannot doubt it is on all sides imperative on
us to limit, and if possible to blot out, all diseases of
whatever kind. Who would assume the responsibility
of letting a preventable evil fester in society, on a
pretence of a knowledge of the divine purposes, or
under the pretext that public morality would be
thereby promoted? The duty which lies nearest to us
must ever have the first claim; and it cannot but be
admitted that the nearest duty each man has to his
fellow is to save him as far as possible from all injury,
even though that injury may arise as the consequence
of his own fault. Nor will it be questioned that the
cause of morality is more advanced by beneficent interference
than by permitting ourselves to stand passively
by whilst intemperance and vice work ruin and infect
the very fountains of life.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. Gull had attained many of the highest
honours of the profession. He was one of the first
graduates of London University to attain a seat on
its Senate, which he continues to occupy. He was
Censor of the College of Physicians in 1859-61 and in
1872-3, and Councillor in 1863-4. Oxford conferred
on him the degree of D.C.L. in 1868, the Royal Society
elected him to its Fellowship in 1869, Cambridge
followed suit with the LL.D, in 1880, and Edinburgh
in 1884. He was appointed a Crown Member of the
General Medical Council in 1871, holding office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> till
1883, when he resigned. His successful attendance on
the Prince of Wales in 1871, in conjunction with Sir
W. Jenner, became the occasion of his receiving a
baronetcy in 1872, and being made Physician-Extraordinary
to the Queen.</p>

<p>The evidence given by Sir William Gull before the
Lords’ committee on intemperance, in 1877, has often
been referred to as one of the most valuable aids to
temperance that a medical man has rendered. He
distinctly assigned a subordinate value to alcohol as
a medicine, and expressed his belief that its value
lay chiefly in its action on the nervous system as a
sedative, not as a stimulant. He further stated that a
very large number of people in society are dying, day
by day, poisoned by alcohol, but not supposed to be
poisoned by it. In the case of inebriates, with most
patients he would not be afraid to stop the use of
alcohol altogether. He sees no good in leaving off
drink by degrees. “If you are taking poison into the
blood, I do not see the advantage of diminishing the
degrees of it from day to day.... I should say, from
my experience, that alcohol is the most destructive
agent that we are aware of in this country.”</p>

<p>His own example is powerfully instructive. “If I
am fatigued with overwork, personally, my food is very
simple. I eat the raisins instead of drinking the wine....
I should join issue at once with those people
who believe that intellectual work cannot be so well
done without wine or alcohol. I should deny that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
proposition and hold the very opposite.” In the life
of James Hinton, by Ellice Hopkins, to which Sir
William Gull has contributed a preface, we learn
another secret of a popular physician’s endurance in
the record of early constitutionals in the parks and
remote suburbs, from six to eight in the morning.</p>

<p>In 1882, in the controversy on Vivisection, Sir
William Gull, writing in the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, showed
that his sympathy with the struggles of physiologists
for their science was combined with a fully answering
appreciation of the value of physiological research to
medicine. “Yearly in this country,” he says, “more
than twenty thousand persons, children and others—mostly
children—die of scarlet fever; and nearly
twenty thousand more of typhoid fever; and one of
the chief causes of this mortality is the high temperature
of the blood, which results from the disturbance
due to the fever process. No wonder therefore that
physiologists and physicians have anxiously and
laboriously occupied themselves in investigating that
mechanism of the living body which in health maintains
so constant a temperature under varying circumstances,
both internal and external, and which becomes
so easily and fatally deranged in disease.... The
febrile state must have arrested attention from the
infancy of man. The mothers of a palæolithic age
must have watched their children consumed to death
in it, as do the mothers of to-day. The name of this
fiery state is as old as literature.... This fiery furnace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
with its uncounted millions of victims, science hopes
to close.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that physiological experiments
are useful, useful for animals as well as for man. They
are therefore justifiable.... Nothing is so cruel as
ignorance. For how many centuries had human
sufferers to bear pain which is now preventable by
better knowledge? How many thousands festered to
death in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: smallpox">small-pox</ins> before the discovery of vaccination?
How many are now dying of tubercle and scrofula
whom a better knowledge of their conditions might
rescue? Yet the pursuit of this knowledge is hindered
in England by the outcry of cruelty—the cruelty being
no more than the inoculation of some of the lower
animals with tubercular and scrofulous matter, in order
to study the course of the disease and the modes of
prevention. The cruelty obviously lies, not in performing
these experiments, but in the hindering of
progressive knowledge.”</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR JAMES PAGET AND SURGICAL PATHOLOGY.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> foremost surgical philosopher and orator of his
day, Sir <span class="smcap">James Paget</span> was called to occupy the
presidential chair of the International Medical Congress
which met in London in August 1881. This was
the culmination of a long career of scientific usefulness
and successful practice. Sir James is a younger
brother of Dr. G. E. Paget, Regius Professor of Medicine
in the University of Cambridge, and was born
at Yarmouth in Norfolk in 1814. After a course
of professional study at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London, Mr. Paget qualified as a member of the
London College of Surgeons in 1836. His energy and
acuteness were soon made manifest to the authorities,
and he was selected to catalogue and describe the
Pathological Museums of St. Bartholomew and also
of the College of Surgeons, in conjunction with Mr.
Stanley. These important works contributed not a
little to establish Mr. Paget’s scientific reputation.</p>

<p>In July 1842 Mr. Paget, while Demonstrator of
Morbid Anatomy at St. Bartholomew’s, published in
the <cite>British and Foreign Medical Review</cite> an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>exhaustive
report on the chief results obtained by the use of
the microscope in the study of human anatomy and
physiology; it was afterwards issued separately. Being
derived from the original authorities, and full references
being given, it was of great value at a critical
period in the growth of the knowledge of minute
anatomy. For some years Mr. Paget drew up valuable
reports on the progress of human anatomy and
physiology.</p>

<p>Forty years ago Mr. Paget was already Warden of
St. Bartholomew’s College and Lecturer on Physiology
in the Hospital. At the opening of the session of
1846 he addressed the students in an eloquent and
practical way on “The Motives to Industry in the
Study of Medicine.” His appeals to the highest
motives were most forceful, and very indicative of the
spirit which was to animate himself throughout life.
“Do not imagine,” he said, “that your responsibilities
will be limited to the events of life or death. As you
visit the wards of this hospital, mark some of the
hardly less portentous questions which, before a few
years are past, you may be permitted to determine.
In one, you will find it a doubt whether the remainder
of the patient’s life is to be spent in misery, or in ease
and comfort; in another, whether he and those who
depend upon his labours are to live in hopeless destitution,
or in comparative abundance. One who used
to help his fellow-men finds ground to fear that he
may be a heavy burthen on their charity. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
counts the days of sickness, not more by pain and
weariness, than by the sufferings and confusion of
those who are left at home without a guide, and, it
may be, starving. Oh, gentlemen! I can imagine no
boldness greater than his would be, who would neglect
the study of his profession, and yet venture on the
charge of interests like these; and I can imagine no
ambition more honourable, no envy so praiseworthy,
as that which strives to emulate the acquirements of
those who are daily occupied in giving safe guidance
through the perilous passages of disease, and who, in
all these various difficulties and dangers, can act with
the energy and calmness that are the just property of
knowledge.”</p>

<p>About the same time Mr. Paget published an
interesting pamphlet containing all the records of
Harvey preserved in the Journals of St. Bartholomew’s,
with notes elucidating them. Meanwhile, having been
appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the
College of Surgeons, an office which he held from 1847
till 1852, the lectures which he delivered being
reported in the medical journals, as well as listened
to with delight by large audiences, were recognised as
among the most masterly modern contributions to
surgical science. His prolonged study of the pathological
collections belonging to the College and to St.
Bartholomew’s in preparing the catalogues, enabled
him to illustrate his lectures in a most interesting and
valuable manner. The lectures were collected and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
published in 1853, and have ever since occupied a
similar lofty position to the lectures on medicine by
Sir Thomas Watson. They illustrate the general
pathology of the principal surgical diseases, in conformity
with modern advances in physiology. In
several recent editions a distinguished pupil of Sir
James Paget, Professor Turner of Edinburgh, has
revised the lectures from the pathological point of
view, while the author has continued to revise them
in their clinical aspect.</p>

<p>The leading topics under which these famous lectures
are comprised are: Nutrition, Hypertrophy, Atrophy,
Repair, Inflammation, Mortification, Specific Diseases,
and Tumours. The concluding passage of the second
lecture, on “The Conditions Necessary to Healthy
Nutrition,” is a fine exposition of a view of the relation
between the mind and a changing brain. “In
all these things, as in the phenomena of symmetrical
disease, we have proofs of the surpassing precision of
the formative process, a precision so exact that, as we
may say, a mark once made upon a particle of blood
or tissue is not for years effaced from its successors.
And this seems to be a truth of widest application;
and I can hardly doubt that herein is the solution of
what has been made a hindrance to the reception of the
whole truth concerning the connection of an immaterial
mind with the brain. When the brain is said to be
essential, as the organ or instrument of the mind in
its relations with the external world, not only to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
perception of sensations, but to the subsequent intellectual
acts, and especially to the memory, of things
which have been the objects of sense—it is asked, how
can the brain be the organ of memory when you
suppose its substance to be ever changing? or how
is it that your assumed nutritive change of all the
particles of the brain is not as destructive of all
memory and knowledge of sensuous things as the
sudden destruction by some great injury is? The
answer is—because of the exactness of assimilation
accomplished in the formative process; the effect once
produced by an impression upon the brain, whether
in perception or in intellectual act, is fixed and there
retained; because the part, be it what it may, which
has been thereby changed, is exactly represented in
the part which, in the course of nutrition, succeeds to
it. Thus, in the recollection of sensuous things, the
mind refers to a brain in which are retained the effects,
or rather the likenesses of changes that past impressions
and intellectual acts had made. As, in some
way passing far our knowledge, the mind perceived
and took cognisance of the change made by the first
impression of an object, acting through the sense
organs on the brain; so afterwards, it perceives and
recognises the likeness of that change in the parts
inserted in the process of nutrition.</p>

<p>“Yet here also the tendency to revert to the former
condition, or to change with advancing years, may
interfere. The impress may be gradually lost or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
superseded, and the mind, in its own immortal nature
unchanged, and immutable by anything of earth, no
longer finds in the brain the traces of the past.”</p>

<p>In 1854 Mr. Paget gave one of the series of lectures
on Education at the Royal Institution, in which
Whewell, Faraday, and others took part. His lecture
on the Importance of the Study of Physiology as a
branch of education for all classes, was marked by
elevation of thought and practicality of aim. One
interesting point that he dwelt on was that a wider
scheme of education would be more likely to discover
men fitted for particular work. “It has seemed like
a chance,” he said, “that has led nearly every one
of our best physiologists to his appropriate work; like
a chance, the loss of which might have consigned him
to a life of failures, in some occupation for which he
had neither capacity nor love.” The value of physiological
instruction is now generally admitted, but the
practical application is almost as generally neglected.</p>

<p>Sir James Paget has published but too few of
his thoughts to the public and the profession; but
all that have been given to the world have been of
sterling worth. His Clinical Lectures and Essays,
collected in 1875, include some of the most interesting
reading imaginable. He deals among other subjects
with the various risks of operations, the calamities
of surgery, stammering with other organs than those
of speech, cases that bone-setters cure, dissection
poisons, and constitutional diseases. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
most instructive of the series are those which describe
forms of nervous mimicry of serious diseases.
An extract from “The Calamities of Surgery” gives
clear expression to Sir James Paget’s views on preparation
for operating:—</p>

<p>“Look very carefully to your apparatus. I have
no doubt that you will look very carefully to the edges
of your knives and your saws and all things that are
mighty to handle; but look to the plaster, look to the
ligatures and the sutures, and all the things which
are commonly called minor. When I have seen Sir
William Fergusson and Sir Spencer Wells operate, I
have never known which to admire most; the complete
knowledge of the things to be done, the skill of
hand, or the exceeding care with which all the apparatus
is adjusted and prepared beforehand. The most
perfect plaster, the most perfect silk, not one trivial
thing left short of the most complete perfection it is
capable of. I have no doubt that the final success of
their operations has been due just as much to these
smaller things as to those greater things of which they
are masters.”</p>

<p>The lecture on Dissection Poisons was especially
called forth by an illness from which he suffered for
three months in 1871, caught from attending the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
mortem</i>
 examination of a patient who had died of
pyæmia. Yet he had no wound or crack of the skin
of any kind. In closing the lecture Sir James remarked:
“Sir William Lawrence used to say that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
had not known any one recover on whose case more
than seven had been consulted. Our art has improved.
I had the happiness of being attended by ten: Sir
Thomas Watson, Sir George Burrows, Sir William
Jenner, Sir William Gull, Dr. Andrew, Dr. Gee, Mr.
Cæsar Hawkins, Mr. Savory, Mr. Thomas Smith, Mr.
Karkeek. In this multitude of counsellors was safety.
The gratitude I owe to them is more than I can tell—more
than all the evidences of my esteem can ever
prove.”</p>

<p>In an address on Theology and Science, delivered to
students at the Clergy School at Leeds, in December
1880, Sir James Paget remarks that “in theology, and
in the Christian faith which it expounds, there are not
only clear evidences which, in their accumulated force,
cannot, I think, be reasonably resisted by those who
will fairly collect and try them; but there are convictions
of religious faith, not always based on knowledge,
or on other evidence than the faith which is
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: &ldquo;the evidence of things unseen,&rdquo;">‘the evidence of things unseen,’</ins> which may justly be
held as unalterable, because they are consistent with
revelation, and have been sustained by the testimony
of clouds of witnesses, and, I believe, have in many
minds the testimony of God’s indwelling Spirit.” He
expresses the belief that the truths and highest probabilities
of science and religion may justly be held
together, though on different grounds, and that they are
not within reach of direct mutual attack. He advises
clerical students, if they touch upon such questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
to undertake some real study in science, by observation,
by experiment, by collecting, as well as by reading.
“And let your reading be in the works of the best
masters, that you may learn their true spirit, their
strength, their methods of observing and thinking,
their accuracy in describing.”</p>

<p>Sir James Paget appears as a champion of moderation
in the <cite>Contemporary</cite> controversy on the Alcohol
Question. He says that the presumption in favour of
moderation is strengthened by comparing those of our
race who do not and those who do habitually use alcoholic
drinks. “As to working power, whether bodily
or mental, there can be no question that the advantage
is on the side of those who use alcoholic drinks. And
it is advantage of this kind which is most to be desired.
Longevity is not the only or the best test of the value
of the things on which we live. It may be only a
long old age, or a long course of years of idleness or
dulness, useless alike to the individual and the race.
That which is most to be desired is a national power
and will for good working and good thinking, and a
long duration of the period of life fittest for these;
and facts show that these are more nearly attained by
the people that drink alcohol than by those who
do not.”</p>

<p>Sir James Paget holds or has held appointments
too numerous to mention. After a long and honourable
career as Assistant-Surgeon and Surgeon to St.
Bartholomew’s, he became Consulting Surgeon. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> a
member of the Council of the College of Surgeons and
for some years President, and also as a member of the
Senate, and for some years Vice-Chancellor of London
University, he has exercised powerful influence on the
improvement of medical education and on medical
politics generally. He is Surgeon to the Prince of
Wales and Serjeant Surgeon-Extraordinary to the
Queen. A baronetcy was conferred upon him in August
1871, and he has received honorary distinctions in
abundance from both British and foreign universities.</p>

<p>In 1882 in his Bradshawe lecture, “On some Rare and
New Diseases,” Sir James Paget remarked on the increase
in the number of real students, which he has had a
large share in creating. “I have been often made happy
by the contrast which I have seen while working at
the new edition of the catalogue of the pathological
specimens in the College of Surgeons’ museum. While
I was writing the last edition, between thirty and
forty years ago, scarcely a student ever entered the
museum. Hour after hour I sat alone; I seemed to
be working for no one but myself, or for nothing but
the general propriety that a museum ought to have
a catalogue, though no one might ever care to study
with it. Now, and for some years past, a day rarely
passes without many pupils and others being at work
in every part of the museum.”</p>

<p>In the same lecture Sir James clearly showed the
value of studying cases not agreeing with the ordinary
types. “We should study all exceptions to rules;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
never thinking of them as unmeaning or accidental.
Especially, we should never use, in its popular but
wrong translation, the expression, ‘exceptio probat
regulam;’ as if an exception to a rule could be evidence
that the rule is right. If we use it, let this be
in its real meaning; translating it, as surgeons should,
that an exception probes the rule, tests it, searches it—as
the Bible says we should ‘prove all things’—to
its very boundary.”</p>

<p>Finally we may quote some sentences from Sir James
Paget’s lecture on “Elemental Pathology,” delivered
before the British Medical Association in 1880, as
expressing his philosophy of life. “I hold it to be
very desirable that every one of us should, all his
life long, study some science in a scientific manner.
There seems to be no equally good method for maintaining
the temper and the habits, which by making
us always good students, will make us as good practitioners
as we can be. There is no method so good for
maintaining a constant habit of inquiry, with accuracy
and perseverance in research, the power of weighing
evidence, of calmly judging, and of accurately speaking;
none better for cultivating the love of truth, the
contempt for fallacies, whether others’ or our own, the
gentleness and courtesy which are appropriate to the
consciousness of the imperfection of our knowledge.”</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>WILLIAMS, STOKES, AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Although</span> this country has not enjoyed the distinction
of introducing that invaluable instrument,
the stethoscope, to medical science, great
interest naturally attaches to those who first used
the stethoscope in this country. And among these
the name of Charles John Blasius Williams is prominent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Williams</span>, the son of a clergyman of a
Cardiganshire family, was born early in the present
century at Heytesbury in Wiltshire, where his father
was perpetual curate, and custos of the Hungerford
almshouse, in which he resided. He was educated
at home by his father. His early liking for natural
science and medicine may be considered to have
come through his mother, who was the daughter of
a surgeon, also named Williams, at Chepstow, and
had been educated by Hannah More’s sisters, and
received instruction in reading from Hannah More
herself. Before the age of fourteen, having access
to some good books on natural philosophy, he had
made for himself two electrifying machines, a battery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of Leyden jars, a voltaic pile, and several little telescopes,
microscopes, kaleidoscopes, and æolian harps.
Thomson’s Chemistry enabled him to carry on extended
chemical experiments, and to start well at
Edinburgh subsequently.</p>

<p>Astronomy, a lifelong hobby, was cultivated in the
family after the reading of Chalmers’s astronomical
discourses; they bought a telescope and did some
really good observing. Active games were not lost
sight of: and the young Charles excelled all his neighhours
in leaping and running. Stilt-walking was a
favourite pursuit; and the youth once made a pair
of stilts with a footing twelve feet from the ground,
mounted on which he could walk well, and look into
the upper windows of the house. Natural history
tastes were further carried out in a somewhat unusual
direction. Poultry and all kinds of domestic animals
were studied so minutely, and their cries imitated so
closely, that Charles could influence their behaviour towards
himself just as if he had been one of themselves.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1820 Charles Williams entered at
Edinburgh University, attending Hope’s interesting
lectures on Chemistry and the dry prelections of
Monro tertius on Anatomy, alternated with Barclay’s
extra-academical class. Later he diligently attended
W. P. Alison’s courses of lectures, and had much personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>instruction from him. He had not proceeded
far in his medical studies before he became absorbed
in chemical physiology, and especially in relation to
respiration and animal heat. Carefully studying all
the most recent chemical discoveries, he made new
experiments showing that the change of colour between
venous and arterial blood could take place when
the blood was enclosed in an animal membrane out of
the body, and surrounded by atmospheric air. Thus in
1823 he anticipated what Professor Graham so largely
developed in relation to the general permeability of
animal membranes. He further discussed the origin
of animal heat, and suggested various developments of
the theory of combustion. The paper, later amplified
into a thesis for graduation in 1824, attracted Alison’s
high commendation, although Hope had returned the
paper with the remark that the subject was quite
proper for a young gentleman’s thesis, but that he
declined to enter into the subject.</p>

<p>In 1824-5 the young doctor heard Charles Bell’s
lectures on the Nervous System at the London College
of Surgeons, and attended the surgical practice of
several of the London hospitals. At midsummer 1825
he went to Paris, and in addition to French literature
studied painting, becoming a good amateur landscape-painter
both in water-colours and oils. In the winter
he attended Majendie’s lectures on Physiology and
the practice of Dupuytren, Laennec, and many others.
But Laennec, the great auscultator, then in his last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
year of life, gained his most ardent devotion. It was
surprising, says Dr. Williams, how little he was valued
by French students. Those who attended his clinique
were chiefly foreigners. M. G. Andral’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>

examinations also he found invaluable.</p>

<p>The chief discoveries relating to auscultation were
undoubtedly Laennec’s; yet his knowledge of acoustics
was by no means profound, and he was often not
successful in explaining rationally the sounds that he
heard in the chest. Dr. Williams soon started in the
path of applying acoustic laws in this field, and in
1828 he produced his valuable “Rational Exposition
of the Physical Signs of Diseases of the Chest,”
suggesting various improvements in the construction
and use of stethoscopes. Returning to London, Dr.
Williams derived great benefits through an introduction
to Dr. (afterwards Sir James) Clark, so long
attached as physician to the Queen, and from the
family acquaintance with Lord Heytesbury. His work
above mentioned was favourably reviewed, and soon
made its way; and many of his explanations are
accepted to the present day. After various travels
with patients, he settled in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,
in 1830, having married his cousin, Miss Harriett
Jenkins, of Chepstow.</p>

<p>Becoming a member of the Royal Institution, Dr.
Williams was introduced to Faraday, and was soon
engaged to write for the “Cyclopædia of Practical
Medicine,” to which he contributed numerous valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
articles on auscultation and diseases of the chest.
In these articles he recommended strongly the cure of
catarrh by the heroic process of reducing the supply
of fluid. The remedial uses of counter-irritation were
carefully expounded: and dyspnœa, difficult or distressed
breathing, was clearly described.</p>

<p>In 1833, while practice grew but slowly, the second
edition of the Rational Exposition was brought out,
containing an enlarged section on the sounds of the
heart in health and disease. For some years Dr.
Williams had considered the questions involved, and
by experimental inquiries in 1835 he established that
several causes to which they had hitherto been ascribed
could not be the cause of the sounds of the
heart, and that the first sound was produced by the
muscular contraction of the ventricles, and the second
by the reaction of the arterial blood tightening the
semilunar valves. His anticipation by Rouanet in
1832 in the latter point has, however, been more
recently made evident. A third edition of his book,
now of increased importance, was published in 1835,
under the title of “The Pathology and Diagnosis of
Diseases of the Chest, illustrated especially by a Rational
Exposition of their Physical Signs.” It was reprinted
in America, and translated into German and Swedish.
The same year he was elected F.R.S.</p>

<p>In 1836 Dr. Williams was asked to give lectures on
Diseases of the Chest at the Anatomical School in
Kinnerton Street, connected with St. George’s Hospital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
In 1836-7 he was president of the Harveian and
the Westminster Medical Societies. In the summer of
1837 he worked to prepare for the second Report of the
British Association Committee on the sounds of the
Heart, in which were brought forward important experimental
results in regard to morbid murmurs associated
therewith. In 1835 he had shown that the
true ground of distinction between different forms of
disease of the heart’s valves lay in the different
direction in which the sonorous currents spread the
sounds, and imparted them to the chest walls. Thus
he first established the distinction between basic and
apex murmurs, developing his views more fully in
1836-7-8.</p>

<p>In 1839 Dr. Williams was elected Professor of
Medicine to University College, and physician to its
hospital on Elliotson’s retirement. Work now crowded
upon him; in the first winter session he gave 150
lectures and examinations in six months, visited the
hospital almost every day, and gave a weekly clinical
lecture. Up to this period <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>
 examinations at
the hospital had been made in a mere open shed, with
a wooden shelf, scarcely screened, and without a table
or a supply of water. Dr. Williams himself planned
a proper <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>
 theatre; and with the plan he
offered £50 towards the cost,—a munificent mode of
action which speedily secured the building of the
required theatre. Dr. Williams’s practical teaching
and luminous lectures caused the Medical School to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
increase still more rapidly. He had a class of over
two hundred. In 1840 an experimental research in
which Dr. Williams was assisted by Prof. Sharpey
proved the muscular contractility of the bronchial
tubes, and confirmed the great influence of belladonna
and stramonium as remedies in asthma, in suspending
this contractility.</p>

<p>The winter of 1840-1 was occupied largely with
original experiments on congestion, determination of
blood, and inflammation, which Dr. Williams treated
of in the Gulstonian Lectures at the College of Physicians
in 1841. His results and views were, as acknowledged
by eminent men recently, twenty-five years in
advance of his time. Both Virchow and Burdon-Sanderson
have acknowledged their great value. Dr.
Williams claims that he first pointed to enlargement
of the arteries leading to a part as the direct physical
cause of determination of blood to that part. “When
the web of a frog’s foot is gently irritated by an aromatic
water, the arteries may be seen through the microscope
to become enlarged, and to supply a fuller and more
impulsive flow of blood to the capillaries and veins,
which then all become enlarged too: the whole vascular
plexus, including vessels which before scarcely
admitted red corpuscles, then becomes the seat of a
largely increased current” (<cite>London Medical Gazette</cite>,
July 1841).</p>

<p>The year 1841 was marked by the first public steps
taken to establish the Hospital for Consumption and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Diseases of the Chest, which originated with Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Philip Rose. A clerk in his firm
suffering consumption found no hospital willing to
admit him, on the plea of the lingering and incurable
nature of the disease. This started the idea of a
special hospital, which Dr. Williams cordially supported,
and to which he became consulting physician.
The history and great success of the Brompton Hospital
cannot be followed here; in 1882 it had 331 beds.
The great Virchow, when he visited it in 1881, said,
“Here <em>everything</em> is done for the sick.”</p>

<p>In 1843 Dr. Williams published the “Principles of
Medicine,” a work in which physiology and pathology
were largely employed to form a basis for scientific
medicine. It was received with high approval, and
became a standard work in America. New editions
appeared in 1848 and in 1856. Sir James Paget and
Sir James Simpson among others have given it the
stamp of their marked approbation. The <cite>Lancet</cite> gave
it almost unqualified praise. In 1846 the Pathological
Society of London was established, and Dr. Williams
was chosen its first president. Its objects were the
exhibition, description, and classification of morbid
specimens, and the promotion of pathological research
by systematic observation and experiments. In his
opening address, Dr. Williams answered the sceptical
question, “What is the use of opening bodies? We
never find what we expected:” by describing a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
mortem</i>
 examination of a remarkable case of pulmonary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
disease. The examination had been concluded before
Dr. Williams arrived, and he was told that there was
enlargement of the heart, which the physician in charge
expected, and was satisfied. Dr. Williams insisted on
careful inspection of the lungs, which disclosed extensive
consolidation, and in addition an unexpected
general dilatation of the bronchial tubes. This was
the case in which he first discovered the connection
between that change and pleuro-pneumonia. The very
appropriate motto of the Society, “Nec silet mors,” was
suggested by Dr. Williams.</p>

<p>At the end of the winter session of 1849 Dr.
Williams resigned his professorship and physiciancy,
his health having severely suffered from overwork, and
private practice increasing rapidly. He removed to
Upper Brook Street, and here continued for twenty-four
years in full practice. In January 1849 Dr.
Williams published his first account in the <cite>London
Journal of Medicine</cite>, on Cod-Liver Oil in Pulmonary
Consumption. He had been studying its application
for three years, but of course the priority in recommending
it belongs to Dr. Hughes Bennett. It was
only in 1846, when a purified oil had been prepared
from the fresh livers of the fish, that Dr. Williams
found patients willing to take the oil, and in 1848 he
wrote that he had prescribed the oil in 400 cases
of tubercular disease of the lungs, and in 206 out of
234 recorded cases its use was followed by marked
improvement. The administration of cod-liver oil <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>is
such a commonplace of the present day that it can
scarcely be realised that it is a novelty almost exclusively
belonging to the present half of the nineteenth
century. And to Dr. Williams very much of the credit,
and of the proof of its efficacy, is due. A lady first
visited on September 3, 1847, appeared at the verge of
death. Cod-liver oil restored her in a few weeks, and
she lived many years after. This was a sample of the
experience which, after many years’ testing, led Dr.
Williams to say, in the great work on pulmonary
consumption published by himself and his son, Dr.
C. T. Williams, in 1871, that the average duration of
life in phthisis had been at least quadrupled. Of 1000
cases tabulated, 802 were still living at the last report,
and many were expected to live for years.</p>

<p>The New Sydenham Society, started in 1858, also
found an apt first president in Dr. Williams. Its
usefulness in improving medical literature by translations
and republications has been and is very great. The
Lumleian Lectures at the College of Physicians followed
in 1862, and were entitled “Successes and Failures
in Medicine.” They were not published till 1871,
when they appeared in the <cite>Medical Times and Gazette</cite>.
Great attention was directed in them to the hopes and
prospects of prevention of disease. In 1873 Dr. Williams
was elected to the Presidency of the Royal Medical
and Chirurgical Society, which he held for two years,
though suffering from gradually increasing deafness.
In 1874 he was appointed Physician-Extraordinary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the Queen. In 1875 he retired to Cannes, where he
has since renewed his earlier astronomical studies,
and made some important observations on sun spots.
So in scientific recreations, and in Biblical studies
in which he has long been deeply interested, the
veteran physician whom Dr. Quain describes as “the
principal founder of our modern school of pathology,”
passes the closing years of a protracted life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Irish Schools of Medicine have had a briefer
history than those of Edinburgh and London, but have
produced men whose character and labours rank
among the highest. <span class="smcap">William Stokes</span>, born in July
1804 in Dublin, was the son of Whitley Stokes,
Regius Professor of Medicine in the University, a man
of lofty aims and untiring energy, and a very successful
teacher of medicine. Father and son alike were
students of the Edinburgh Medical School; but the
son owed much to personal companionship with his
father. After a few months at Glasgow, young Stokes
entered at Edinburgh early in 1823, and soon came in
contact with Dr. Alison, who exercised a profound
influence upon him; “the best man I ever knew,” he
declared. Such striking progress did he make, that
before he left Edinburgh, in 1825, he had written and
published a little book on “The Use of the Stethoscope,”
which he was fortunate enough to sell for £70.</p>

<p>On settling in Dublin, young though he was, Stokes
was elected Physician to the Meath Hospital, in succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
to his father. His colleague, Graves, one of the
most remarkable men Dublin had produced, exercised
a striking influence over him. At twenty-two Stokes
was already lecturing and giving clinical instruction
to a crowd of pupils. The time was one of acute
distress and poverty in Ireland; fever raged in Dublin,
owing to the distress caused by the failure of the
potato crop in the summer of 1826. The Meath
Hospital was crowded, and the young physician was
taxed to the utmost, and his benevolent charity became
fixed as a second nature.</p>

<p>During these years of activity, a powerful special
object was employing his most persistent thought and
observation. He was diligently storing his mind with
every fact and inference bearing on diseases of the
lungs. In 1837 his observations were published in the
classic work on “Diseases of the Chest.” It at once
placed him, says Sir Henry Acland in the memoir
prefixed to the edition published by the New Sydenham
Society in 1882, in the front rank of observers and
thinkers. His exposition of the use of auscultation in
bronchitis and the affections of the chest was most
valuable.</p>

<p>In 1842 Stokes became Regius Professor of Physic
in Dublin University, in succession to his father. From
this time, though he contributed occasional papers,
lectures, and cases of value to the <cite>Dublin Journal of
Medical Science</cite>, and to the medical societies, he
published no book till 1854, when a valuable treatise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
on Diseases of the Heart confirmed his reputation.
In this he paid great attention to functional disturbances
of the heart, where no organic disease was
present. He says with great modesty, “the diagnosis
of the combinations of diseases, even in so small an
organ as the heart, is still to be worked out.... As
the student fresh from the schools, and proud of his
supposed superiority in the refinements of diagnosis,
advances into the stern realities of practice, he will be
taught greater modesty, and a more wholesome caution.
He will find, especially in chronic disease, that important
changes may exist without corresponding physical
signs—that as disease advances its original special
evidences may disappear—that the signs of a recent
and trivial affection at one portion of the heart may
altogether obscure, or prevent, those of a disease longer
in standing and much more important—that functional
alteration may not only cause the signs of organic
lesion to vary infinitely, but even to wholly disappear—that
the signs on which he has formed his opinion
to-day may be wanting to-morrow; and, lastly, that to
settle the simple question between the existence of
functional and that of organic disease, will occasionally
baffle the powers of even the most enlightened and
experienced physicians.”</p>

<p>This treatise is acknowledged to be one of the most
acute, graphic, and complete accounts of the clinical
aspects of heart disease. In 1854 also he published a
series of lectures on Fever in the <cite>Medical Times and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Gazette</cite>, which were collected into a volume, with additions
in 1874. Here he showed himself as still sceptical
of the advances made by Jenner, Murchison, and others.
As he wrote in one of the lectures, “there is nothing
more difficult than for a man who has been educated
in a particular doctrine to free himself from it, even
though he has found it to be wrong,” and he could
never free himself from Alison’s strong belief that
fevers were essentially alike.</p>

<p>Very early in his career Stokes was overwhelmed
with private practice. On more than one occasion he
spoke and wrote strongly regarding the exertions
and the mortality of Irish doctors in combating fevers
and cholera, while receiving the merest pittance from
Government for their services. His feelings as to
everything relating to the welfare of the profession and
the general culture of the student were actively displayed.
“Let us emancipate the student,” he said,
“and give him time and opportunity for the cultivation
of his mind, so that in his pupilage he shall not be a
puppet in the hands of others, but rather a self-relying
and reflecting being. Let us ever foster the general
education in preference to the special training, not
ignoring the latter, but seeing that it be not thrust
upon a mind uncultivated or degraded.”</p>

<p>Prevention of disease, too, engaged Stokes’s earnest
attention, before sanitary science had come into fashion.
“A time may come,” he said, in closing one of his
addresses, “when the conqueror of disease will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> more
honoured than the victor in a hundred fights.”</p>

<p>Sir Henry Acland says of Stokes: “The study of
man was with him an instinct, both on the material
and on the intellectual side. On the material side;
for he was a physiognomist, a great judge of character,
and had a keen perception of all physical characteristics,
qualities which he obtained by intense observation of
men in disease, of men in health, and of persons in
every class of society and every kind of occupation.
On the intellectual side; for the phenomena of man’s
external nature were to him only expressions of the
mind working within,—mind the result of inheritance—mind
formed by itself—mind the result of circumstance.
The second thing to be remarked was his intense
interest in every form of human character, in
persons of every age, occupation, and condition. He
had that which many accomplished persons have not,
the keenest sense of humour, which sparkled up in a
way quite indescribable. He combined with real
delight in all intellectual development the most
tender human interest.”</p>

<p>Stokes was passionately fond both of natural scenery
and of landscape art; and he enjoyed the companionship
and friendship of the best artists, and at the same
time appreciated greatly the interests of humble life
and the racy humour of the Irish peasantry. He wrote
some charming descriptions of scenery, and was well
acquainted with various schools of art. The antiquities
and history of Ireland too, found in him an accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and appreciative student; and it was felt to
be an appropriate tribute to his variety of taste as well
as his professional skill when he was chosen President
of the Royal Irish Academy in 1874.</p>

<p>One valuable habit Dr. Stokes ascribed to his father.
“My father left me but one legacy, the blessed gift of
rising early.” This often meant getting up between
four and five, when he would study and write till eight.
During a long day’s practice he was always exercising
the most genial influence, whether over refractory
students or harassed patients. At the close of the day
his hospitality was as attractive as his professional
manner during the earlier hours.</p>

<p>In 1870 Mrs. Stokes died, and from this blow her
husband never fully recovered. In 1876 he found
himself compelled to withdraw from his many public
posts, and retire to his cottage at Carigbraig, where to
the last the flights of birds which he had encouraged
and trained came to seek their food at his hands. He
died on January 6, 1878.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR HENRY THOMPSON AND CREMATION.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> mode of disposing of the remains of the dead
is naturally one upon which doctors may be
expected to have a good deal to say. As guardians
of the health of the living, the dangers and diseases
which the material remnants of our deceased friends
may occasion the living must concern the medical profession.
The increasingly dense aggregation of human
beings in great towns has impressed the last two
generations with the necessity of doing something to
prevent disease from spreading through delay in burial,
and the use of unsuitable burial-places. But for the
most part the efforts which have been made have
only taken the form of pushing the evil a little further
off; and a little mathematical calculation will show
that the present cemeteries must soon be surrounded
by habitations, and some fresh arrangements will
have to be made. To cope with these evils the practice
of cremation has been vigorously advocated, as
a more rational and healthy mode of disposing of
the dead, by the Cremation Society, of which Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry Thompson</span> is the President.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>
<p>This distinguished surgeon is the son of Mr. Henry
Thompson of Framlingham, Suffolk, having been born
on August 6, 1820. It is stated that Mr. Thompson
objected to his son’s studying medicine, believing that
the profession had a sceptical tendency. Thus it was
not till he had reached the age of twenty-one, and
became entitled to some property in his own right,
that the subject of this chapter was free to pursue
his chosen profession. He studied chiefly at University
College, London, and also in Paris. He obtained the
M.B. degree at London University in 1851, and the
Fellowship of the College of Surgeons in 1853, and
in the same year was appointed assistant-surgeon at
University College Hospital. In 1852 and again in
1860 he won the Jacksonian Prize at the College of
Surgeons for essays on subjects to which he had
devoted much of his life-work.</p>

<p>The two works on which Sir Henry Thompson’s
reputation among the medical profession chiefly rests
are his “Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Urinary
Organs,” and his “Practical Lithotomy and Lithotrity,”
both of which have gone through numerous editions; but
he has also written many smaller treatises on allied subjects,
and his articles in Holmes’s “System of Surgery”
almost reach the dimensions of separate works. His
practice has grown to large dimensions in this department,
and in 1877 he was able to publish a list with
particulars of 500 cases in which he had performed
operations for stone in the bladder, being he believed
the largest ever published by an operator. The unrivalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
extent, also, to which he was enabled to utilise
the experience of other surgeons, by their communication
of their cases to him, made his book on lithotomy
and lithotrity of unique value.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Thompson is known to have made very
large use of the operation devised by Civiale of Paris,
in 1817, for crushing stones into powder or gravel,
rendering it unnecessary to perform the serious operation
of lithotomy. Civiale’s first operations of this
kind were performed in 1824, and to him the introduction
and successful application of the method is
due. The operation has been largely improved of late
years, and much of this is due to Sir Henry Thompson.
Owing to his well-known skill in this department of
practice, he was called in to the late King of the
Belgians in 1863, and succeeded in affording him relief
by operation, when the most distinguished Continental
surgeons had failed. The honour of knighthood was
subsequently conferred upon Mr. Thompson by Queen
Victoria in recognition of his great services to her
uncle. About this time Sir Henry became full surgeon
to University College Hospital. He has since relinquished
active work at the hospital, becoming Consulting
Surgeon and Emeritus Professor.</p>

<p>Sir Henry has become known to the public in connection
with several important social and religious
questions. One which excited much controversy was
his letter to Professor Tyndall in regard to prayer for
the sick, which appeared in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
in 1872. After classifying the various objects of
prayer, and considering the possibility of testing the
actual results of prayer, he says: “There appears to
be one source from a study of which the absolute
calculable value of prayer (I speak with the utmost
reverence) can almost certainly be ascertained. I mean
its influence in affecting the course of a malady, or
in averting the fatal termination. For it must be
admitted that such an important influence manifestly
either does, or does not exist. If it does, a careful
investigation of diseased persons by good pathologists,
working with this end seriously in view, must determine
the fact. The fact determined, it is simply a
matter of further careful clinical observation to estimate
the extent or degree in which prayer is effective.
And the next step would be to consider how far it
is practicable to extend this benefit among the sick
and dying. And I can conceive few inquiries which
are more pregnant with good to humanity when this
stage has been arrived at.”</p>

<p>The practical method proposed for testing the question
was that a single ward or hospital, under the care
of first-rate doctors, containing patients suffering from
diseases best understood, should be made a subject of
special prayer by the whole body of the faithful for
three or five years, and that at the end of that time
the mortality should be compared with the past rates,
and also with that of other leading hospitals during the
same period. But the experiment was never tried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
owing to the storm of obloquy and controversy with
which the proposal was greeted, in which scant regard
was paid to the evident good faith of the proposer.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Thompson soon came before the public
in a new light. Having failed to get people to pray
systematically for the sick, he next attempted to induce
them to burn their dead, a proceeding which, as it
appeared, was little less shocking to many than the
former proposition had proved. The first paragraph
of his first article in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite>
(January 1874), since reprinted, with a second on the
same subject, struck a sensational key.</p>

<p>“After death! The last faint breath had been noted,
and another watched for so long, but in vain. The
body lies there, pale and motionless, except only that
the jaw sinks slowly but perceptibly. The pallor
visibly increases, becomes more leaden in hue, and the
profound tranquil sleep of death reigns where just now
were life and movement. Here then begins the eternal
rest.</p>

<p>“Rest! no, not for an instant. Never was there
greater activity than at this moment exists in that still
corpse. Activity, but of a different kind to that which
was before. Already a thousand changes have commenced.
Forces innumerable have attacked the dead.
The rapidity of the vulture, with its keen scent for
animal decay, is nothing to that of nature’s ceaseless
agents now at full work before us.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>
<p>After explaining the process of animal decomposition,
and describing the various modes of disposing of
the dead between which it is necessary to choose, the
writer went on to insist that our present mode of burial
is certainly injurious to health either now or in the
future, and constitutes in reality a social sin of no
small magnitude. A curious aspect of this question
was brought to light by the mention of the large annual
importation of bones for manuring the soil, while we
bury a vast quantity of human bones annually, too
deep in the earth to be useful agriculturally. The
evils of burial customs and expenditure were also
dwelt upon, and then the new, yet old plan of cremation
was advocated, practically following nature’s indication,
and hastening the process so as to make it safe,
without unpleasantness. It was suggested that funeral
rites could be most appropriately associated with
cremation. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust” would
express a literal and evident fact. The condition of
many churchyards, past and present, has given conclusive
evidence that the present mode of burial consigns
moist remains to water or damp, and generates loathsome
effluvia, too often causing severe disease in those
living near.</p>

<p>This subject is still one of controversy, though it has
emerged into “practical politics” by reason of a decision
by Mr. Justice Stephen that cremation is not
illegal under the present law. Sir Henry Thompson
continues his vigorous efforts in favour of cremation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>
<p>Sir Henry has also distinguished himself as an advocate
for great moderation and even total abstinence in
the use of intoxicating liquors, stating that without
them he can do his work better and with more zest,
and that his constitution has improved under abstinence.
Among his lighter works, “Food and Feeding”
is pleasant and popular; while a still later display of
varied literary tastes is seen in a medical novel,
“Charley Kingston’s Aunt,” published under the
pseudonym of Pen Oliver.</p>

<p>The artistic tastes and attainments of Sir Henry
Thompson are well known. He studied painting under
Elmore and Alma Tadema, and has frequently exhibited
at the Royal Academy. He has a very fine
collection of blue and white Nankin china, of which a
quarto catalogue has been published.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>GRAVES, HUGHES BENNETT, AND
CLINICAL TEACHING.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> subjects of this chapter, both men of great influence,
left a decisive mark on the systems of clinical
teaching in their respective schools of medicine, besides
rendering great services to physiology and to medicine.</p>

<p>In Dublin University a Regius Professorship of
Physic dates from the time of the Restoration, and
other chairs were subsequently founded. The Irish
College of Surgeons was established as late as 1784,
but nothing great came of it for many years. A Scotchman,
Cheyne, settled in Dublin, published in 1817 the
first volume of the Dublin Hospital Reports, and by
the excellence of his own clinical reports on cases of
fever, gave a good tone to the work of the Irish school.
But the elevation of the Dublin Medical School to the
high rank which it has ever since maintained was the
work emphatically of Robert Graves and of William
Stokes.</p>

<p>The Graves family, descended from a colonel in
Cromwell’s cavalry, who had acquired considerable
estates in Limerick county after Cromwell’s subjugation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
of the country, was represented at the close of the
last century by the Regius Professor of Divinity in
Dublin University, and one of the senior Fellows of
Trinity College, Richard Graves, D.D. His three sons,
Richard, Hercules, and Robert obtained at the degree
examinations of three successive years the gold medal
in science and in classics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert James Graves</span>, born in 1795 or 1796, after
going through a complete arts course, and such medical
study as Dublin then afforded, graduated M.B. at
Dublin in 1818. He then betook himself to other
schools, and successively studied in London, in the
most celebrated Continental schools, and in Edinburgh,
being away from Dublin more than three years. He
had an excellent language-faculty, and once, having
forgotten his passport, was imprisoned for ten days in
Austria as a German spy, the authorities insisting that
no Englishman could possibly speak German as he did.
During his stay in Italy, Graves, who had considerable
artistic capacity, accidentally made the acquaintance
of Turner, the celebrated painter, and became his companion
on many journeys. An interesting notice of
Graves’ intercourse with Turner has been given by
Professor Stokes.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It appears that the two lived and
travelled together for months without either of them
inquiring the name of his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>On a voyage from Genoa to Sicily Graves’ courage
and decision were strikingly put to the test when the
captain and crew, in a terrific gale, were about to quit
the ship in the only boat, leaving the two passengers to
their fate. Graves, though ill, seized an axe, and stove
in the boat, took command, repaired the pumps from
the leather of his own boots, and saved the ship.</p>

<p>In 1821 Graves returned to Dublin, and at once took
a leading position. Dr. Stokes, for a short time his
pupil, and his <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: life-long">lifelong</ins> friend, says of him at this time:
“Nature had been bountiful to him: he was tall in
stature, of dark complexion, and with noble and
expressive features. In conversation he possessed a
power rarely met with; for while he had the faculty of
displaying an accurate and singularly varied knowledge
without a shade of egotism, he was able to correct
error without an approach to offence. He had at
once a warm and a sensitive heart, and ever showed
lasting and therefore genuine gratitude for the smallest
kindness. Loving truth for its own sake, he held in
unconcealed abhorrence all attempts to sully or distort
it; and he never withheld or withdrew his friendship
from any, even those below him in education and social
rank, if he found in them the qualities which he loved,
and which he never omitted to honour.”</p>

<p>“It is to be observed that as his mind was open and
unsuspicious, he occasionally fell into the error of
thinking aloud without considering the nature of his
audience, and of letting his wit play more freely, and
his sarcasm, when defending the right, cut more deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
than caution might dictate.”</p>

<p>During the year 1821 Graves was elected physician
to the Meath Hospital, and also became one of the
founders of the Park Street School of Medicine. At
this time clinical investigation and clinical teaching
could scarcely be said to exist, and the pathological
studies of other schools were rather held in contempt.
The methods in vogue in Edinburgh had not impressed
Graves favourably. Students were not then regularly
called upon to investigate cases for themselves, nor
trained in so doing: they might obtain their degree
without having ever practised diagnosis or co-operated
in curing disease even to the extent of writing a prescription.
“Often have I regretted,” said Graves in his
introductory lecture at the Meath Hospital in 1821,
“that, under the present system, experience is only to
be acquired at a considerable expense of human life.
There is, indeed, no concealing the truth—the melancholy
truth, that numbers of lives are annually lost in
consequence of maltreatment. The victims selected for
this sacrifice at the shrine of experience, generally
belong to the poorer classes of society, and their immolation
is never long delayed when a successful candidate
for a dispensary commences the discharge of his duty.
The rich, however, do not always escape; nor is the
possession of wealth in every instance a safeguard
against the blunders of inexperience.”</p>

<p>After commenting on the evil effects of ignorant dogmatism
in those of riper years, Dr. Graves went on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
expound the plan of Continental clinical instruction.
He then alluded to the coarse, harsh, and even vulgar
expressions made use of towards hospital patients by
Irish medical men of the day, insisting on the necessity
of reform in this respect.</p>

<p>The plan that Graves adopted and worked so successfully,
essentially consisted in giving to the advanced
students charge over particular patients, requiring them
to report upon the origin, progress, and present state of
their diseases. At the bedside these particulars were
verified or challenged by the physician; and then in
the lecture-room he discussed with the class the diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of the cases. The pupil
in charge prescribed for the patient, and his prescription
was revised and corrected by the physician. The
advantages of this system were obvious; students being
obliged to give reasons for every plan of cure, became
accustomed to a rational and careful investigation of
disease, and enjoyed the great benefit of the early correction
of their errors.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the system met with much opposition,
and even ridicule. As Stokes says, the student was
then kept at a distance; no one cared to show him how
to teach himself, to familiarise him with “the ways of
the sick,” to train his mind to reason, and to inculcate
the duty as well as the pleasure of original work.</p>

<p>Graves had both knowledge and eloquence; his style
was massive, nervous, and forcible; he could command
the minds of his hearers, and he showed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
thoroughly in earnest. “His active mind was ever on
the search for analogies, and thus he was led to the
discrimination of things apparently similar, and to the
assimilation of things at the first view dissimilar, in a
degree hardly surpassed by any teacher of medicine.”</p>

<p>Having been elected a Fellow of the King’s and
Queen’s College of Physicians, Graves was subsequently
appointed Professor of the Institutes of Medicine. In
this capacity he gave lectures in which physiology was
ably applied to the wants of medical students. In the
years 1828-36 he contributed many physiological
essays, chiefly to the <cite>Dublin Journal of Medical Science</cite>,
of which he was one of the editors till his death, on
such subjects as “The Distinctive Characters of Man,”
“The Chances of Life,” “Temperament and Appetite,”
“The Sense of Touch,” &amp;c., all interesting. But it was
not till 1843 that he published the work on which
his reputation as an author chiefly rests, his “Clinical
Lectures on the Practice of Medicine.” In relation to
this one needs no higher authority in its favour than
that of Trousseau, who addressed to the translator of
the French edition a letter from which we make the
following extracts.</p>

<p>“I have constantly read and re-read the work of
Graves; I have become inspired with it in my teaching....
The lectures on scarlatina, paralysis, pulmonary
affections, cough, headache, have acquired an
European reputation.... When he inculcated the necessity
of giving nourishment in long-continued pyrexias,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
the Dublin physician, single-handed, assailed an opinion
which appeared to be justified by the practice of all
ages, for low diet was then regarded as an indispensable
condition in the treatment of fevers. Had he rendered
no other service than that of completely reversing
medical practice upon this point, Graves would by that
act alone have acquired an indefeasible claim to our
gratitude.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, I cannot sufficiently recommend
the perusal of the lectures which treat of paralysis;
they contain a complete doctrine, and this doctrine has
decisively triumphed. The sympathetic paralyses of
Whytt and Prochaska have now their place assigned
in science, under the much more physiological name of
reflex paralyses.”</p>

<p>“Graves is a therapeutist full of resources.... There
is not a day that I do not in my practice employ some of
the modes of treatment which Graves excels in describing
with the minuteness of the true practitioner, and
not a day that I do not, from the bottom of my heart,
thank the Dublin physician for the information he has
given me.”</p>

<p>“Graves is in my acceptation of the term a perfect
clinical teacher. An attentive observer, a profound
philosopher, an ingenious artist, an able therapeutist, he
commends to our admiration the art whose domain he
enlarges, and the practice of which he renders more
useful and more fertile.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>
<p>In 1843 and 1844 Graves was President of the Irish
College of Physicians, and was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1849. He was led by his experience
to hold strongly the belief that typhus and typhoid were
not distinct fevers. His great service to the treatment
of fevers is however independent of this. He recognised
the ill effects of a lowering system upon fever patients,
and steadily set himself to maintain the patient’s
strength by food and stimulants. One day he was
going round the hospital, when on entering the convalescent
ward he began to expatiate on the healthy
appearance of some who had recovered from severe
typhus. “This is all the effect of our good feeding,” he
exclaimed; “and lest, when I am gone, you may be at
a loss for an epitaph for me, let me give you one, in
three words:—</p>

<p class="p1 center">“HE FED FEVERS.”</p>

<p>Graves’s papers on Cholera embodied in his Clinical
Lectures give an able history of the progress of that
disease, and his researches led him to urge the foundation
of a complete network of medical observatories to
record especially the rise, progress, and character of
disease, whether endemic or epidemic. Had he lived he
might have done much to promote this object, only now
and partially being attempted in the collective scheme
for the investigation of disease under the auspices of
the International Scientific Congress. But his labours
shortened his life. He constantly corresponded with
pupils all over the world; wrote much for periodical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
literature on subjects outside medicine, even doing the
literary work of a patient whose family were in straitened
circumstances. A disease of the liver finally cut
him off, after a protracted illness borne with Christian
fortitude and faith, on March 20, 1853.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Having been a leading teacher at Edinburgh for many
years, <span class="smcap">John Hughes Bennett</span> impressed his individuality
upon a larger number of students, and has been
more generally recognised than Graves as a man of conspicuous
merit. As a clinical teacher, as a physiologist,
as a pathologist, as a therapeutist, he had high claims.
He reformed the treatment both of pneumonia and of
phthisis, and identified a disease, leucocythæmia, whose
characters have proved the starting-point for most fruitful
investigations.</p>

<p>Bennett was born in London on August 31, 1812,
and educated at the Grammar and Mount Radford
Schools, Exeter. He was fortunate in having a cultivated
mother, a lady of independent thought and spirit,
and to her he owed the development of his marked
literary and artistic tastes. As a boy she trained him
in elocution, in which he afterwards excelled, and
widened his thoughts by taking him again and again
to the Continent.</p>

<p>Deciding to study medicine, young Bennett was
apprenticed to a Mr. Sedgwick of Maidstone, and for
a short time attended St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. A
little later, however, he decided to enter at Edinburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
University, and soon showed himself an assiduous
student. He made the acquaintance of Edward Forbes,
J. H. Balfour, John Reid, and others, who afterwards
distinguished themselves, and became one of the
Presidents of the Royal Medical Society. In 1837
he took the M.D. degree, being awarded a gold medal,
on Syme’s recommendation, for the best surgical report,
and being mentioned as worthy of a second medal by
Sir Charles Bell.</p>

<p>Bennett next studied for two years in Paris, founding
the Parisian Medical Society, of which he was the
first president. Other two years he devoted to study
in German medical schools. The microscope and the
stethoscope became in his hands familiar implements
of research, and he already began to give forth the
results of his study, contributing to Tweedie’s “Library
of Medicine” a large proportion of the second volume
dealing with diseases of the nervous system.</p>

<p>Bennett returned to Edinburgh in 1841, and on the
1st October published “Treatise on the Oleum Jecoris
Aselli, or Cod-liver Oil, as a Therapeutic Agent in
certain Forms of Gout, Rheumatism, and Scrofula, with
Cases.” His knowledge of this remedy had been
acquired in Germany, where cod-liver oil was being
used in the treatment of these diseases. Its use had
however long been known among the Scotch fishing
folk, and Drs. Kay and Bardsley had many years before
prescribed it in the Manchester Infirmary. The publication,
however, stagnated, and there was added in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
1847 to the remaining copies an appendix of cases
benefited by cod-liver oil. By this time its administration
was decidedly on the increase, and one firm of
druggists in Edinburgh had sold six hundred gallons
in the preceding year, as compared with one gallon in
1841. At the same time Dr. C. J. B. Williams was
introducing purer forms of the oil in London, as we
have already related, and by his writings and practice
and study of cases of pulmonary consumption did
very much to promote its general use.</p>

<p>In November 1841 Bennett started a course of
lectures on histology at Edinburgh, in which he illustrated
physiology and pathology by microscopical
preparations: he also formed classes for private instruction
in microscopical manipulation. At that time
minute changes in structure were generally overlooked,
and to Bennett belongs the credit of first giving such
instruction in a systematic form. He strongly desired
to gain the chair of General Pathology at Edinburgh,
which was vacant in 1842, but he was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>When he was soon afterwards appointed physician
to the Royal Dispensary, Bennett had an opportunity
of putting into practice what he had learnt in Germany,
by establishing what he called a polyclinical course,
his students being taught practically, under the eye of
the teacher, to examine and prescribe for patients. It
must not be forgotten, however, that Syme had previously
introduced a somewhat similar procedure at
his Minto House (Surgical) Hospital. As Pathologist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to the Royal Infirmary, Bennett had great opportunities
of studying morbid specimens, and he got together a
large pathological collection. He further gave courses
of lectures on pathology.</p>

<p>For many years Bennett took a large part in maintaining
the literary activity of the Edinburgh School.
Many papers by him appeared in the <cite>London and
Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science</cite>, of which
he subsequently was part and sole proprietor two or
three times, being so lucky as to make a profit on each
of his transactions.</p>

<p>In 1848 Dr. Bennett was unanimously elected Professor
of the Institutes of Medicine (<i>i.e.</i>, Physiology)
at Edinburgh. In this new work he was soon conspicuous
for the practicality of his teaching, and for
his continual introduction of matters bearing on pathology
and medicine. He made every lecture a complete
study, enriching it with all the appliances, material
and artistic, that he could command, and embellishing
it by finished elocution. He would now and again
lay aside his manuscript to comment upon, and frequently
to denounce, the opinions of others, by which
course he made enemies, for he was not sufficiently
measured in his treatment of opponents. Yet it might
safely be said that he was not actuated by personal
hostility, but only by antagonism of view. Still
he was too favourable to his own work, and did
not adequately appreciate other men. The general
student enjoyed those peculiarities of Dr. Bennett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> of
which he did not himself feel the brunt, but in the
clinical class or in the examination hall his unsparing
logical acumen tasked the student mind somewhat
severely, and he was a generally dreaded examiner.</p>

<p>From the peculiar organisation of Edinburgh work
Bennett was expected to be a clinical teacher of
medicine as well as a professor of physiology; thus
the importance of his work in the infirmary was as
great as that in the lecture-room. He was a clinical
teacher of the highest order—nothing was suffered
to pass unnoticed. All methods of inquiry into the
patient’s case were diligently taught to the students,
who were led to observe precisely and methodically
for themselves. He would test and stimulate his
pupils<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> most acutely by disputation, questioning, and
argument; and he thus trained a body of men who
carry his impress into all their work.</p>

<p>In 1845 Dr. Bennett published a case of “Hypertrophy
of the Spleen and Liver,” which is the first recorded
case of a disease characterised by a great abundance of
white corpuscles in the blood, now known as leucocythæmia.
Although Bennett did not at first recognise
its true nature, his description and subsequent labours
did much to elucidate the disease, and his name must
be honourably associated with the subject.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the greatest service Bennett rendered
to medicine, independently of his promotion
of the use of cod-liver oil in phthisis, is his strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>protest against the lowering treatment in pneumonia
and other inflammatory diseases. On this point the
<cite>Lancet</cite> (October 9, 1875) says: “He reduced the mortality
of uncomplicated pneumonia to <em>nil</em>. He demonstrated,
not only the dispensableness, but the injuriousness,
of the antiphlogistic treatment which had ruled
the best minds of the civilised world for ages. Doubtless
other physicians were working in the same direction
even before Bennett, but he devised a treatment
of his own which has given most brilliant results, and
he adhered to it and to the pathological views on
which it was based so steadily and over so long a
series of years as to establish its truth, and so largely
revolutionise the practice of medicine in acute diseases.”
Dr. Bennett’s later attacks on the mercurial
treatment of liver diseases were almost equally strong
with that on bleeding and the antiphlogistic methods,
but being undertaken late in life did not leave such an
impression.</p>

<p>Dr. M’Kendrick gives in the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>,
October 9, 1875, a list of no fewer than 105 papers
and memoirs by Bennett. Among his larger works were
“An Introduction to Clinical Medicine;” “Lectures on
Clinical Medicine,” 1850-6, which were entitled in later
editions “Clinical Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine.” Of this his principal work, six editions
were published during his lifetime in the United States,
and the book has been translated into French, Russian,
and Hindoo. “Outlines of Physiology” appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
in 1858, and a Text-book of Physiology in 1871-2.
His works on Cancerous and Cancroid Growths, on the
Pathology and Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis,
and on the Restorative Treatment of Pneumonia, will
of course be consulted as containing authoritative
statements of his views on these important subjects.
He wrote the article on Phthisis in Reynolds’ “System
of Medicine,” Reports on the Action of Mercury on the
Liver, and Researches on the Antagonism of Medicines,
as reports to the British Medical Association, 1867-1875.</p>

<p>Dr. M’Kendrick, some time Bennett’s assistant and
deputy, says of him:<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “Professor Bennett was a man
of clear and logical intellect. What he wanted in
breadth of view he gained in penetrative power. Few
could grasp more quickly the essentials of a subject,
or perceive sooner or more accurately the real point
at issue. <em>Method</em> was the prevailing quality of his
mind which guided him as a teacher.... He wanted
patience with details, the power of positive scientific
expression, and the faculty of taking a wide view of
all the facts bearing on what was immediately under
discussion. He assumed an attitude of scepticism to
all questions until fairly convinced.”</p>

<p>“His tendency to indulge freely in critical and sarcastic
remarks upon the works of others did not make
him a general favourite with some of his professional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>brethren, consequently he never attained a large practice
as a consulting physician, which was from other
considerations his due. He was too much a reformer,
too pronounced and outspoken in his opinions; he had
too much identified himself with certain lines of
thought; and it must be confessed that he did not
possess that indefinable manner which inspires confidence
both in patient and in practitioner alike.”</p>

<p>“By those who knew him best Dr. Bennett was much
beloved. He shone in the social circle, where his love
of music and power of brilliant conversation cast a
radiance through the room.”</p>

<p>In 1855 Bennett unsuccessfully competed for the
chair of the Practice of Physic at Edinburgh, and he
felt his non-success very much. For the next ten
years he continued in active work, but in 1865 began
to suffer severely from a bronchial and throat affection.
Later he was attacked by diabetes, and had to spend
several winters on the Continent. In 1874 he resigned
his professorship. In August 1875 he was gratified
by receiving from Edinburgh the LL.D. degree, his
bust by Brodie being presented to the University
by former pupils. He was operated on for stone in
September following at Norwich, by Mr. Cadge, and
died on September 25th, being buried at Dean Cemetery,
Edinburgh, by the side of his friends, Goodsir
and Edward Forbes. His wife, son, and four daughters
survived him.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>CONOLLY, MAUDSLEY, AND MENTAL DISEASES.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> modern realisation of the association of mental
with physical health, the annexation to the sphere
of biology of the phenomena of mind, and the concurrent
comprehension of the true attitude of the physician
towards mental diseases, have doubtless put into the
shade achievements less than a century old, and some
of them dating from only fifty years ago. Yet the
simple discontinuance of the system of restraint practised
from time immemorial on almost all lunatics was
perhaps a greater practical revolution than the biological
one just referred to; and England stands in the
forefront of this revolution.</p>

<p>The old lunatic asylums of this country were objects
of dread and repulsion. Severity was considered to
be an absolute necessity in their management. “The
affrighted visitors,” says Conolly,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “saw that many were
furious ... and it never occurred to them that habitual
severity was the real cause of the habitual fury.”
New Bethlem in Moorfields two centuries ago was a
place of chains, manacles, and stocks. Down to 1770
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>the inmates were exhibited to the public at a charge of
twopence, afterwards reduced to one penny.</p>

<p>The medical profession had become accustomed to
neglect mental diseases, and to acquiesce in severe
treatment. Cruelty became developed in ingenious
forms. In some Continental asylums patients were
terrified by the gradual ascent of water in a well in
which they were chained. Machines were imagined
by which a newly arrived lunatic could suddenly be
raised to the top of a tower, and as suddenly lowered
into a deep dark cavern; “if the patient could be made
to alight among snakes and serpents, it would be better
still.” A revolving chair was invented, in which the
victim could be strapped and made to gyrate at the
rate of one hundred revolutions per minute. This was
eulogised as a potent means of quieting the unmanageable,
and was supposed to induce the melancholy to
take “a natural interest in the affairs of life.” We can
only make this passing allusion to the way in which
ingenuity was exhausted in devising methods of restraint
and torture.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been worse than the condition
of the Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière, the two large asylums
of Paris, when Pinel was in 1793 appointed to the
former by Cousin, Thouret, and Cabanis, then newly
appointed administrators of the Parisian hospitals.
Damp, dark cells, infested by rats, contained dirt-coated
beings whose only comfort was a little straw, chained,
brutally ill-treated, and attended by brutal criminals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
For nearly ten years previously Pinel’s attention had
been directed to the treatment of the insane, and now,
in spite of difficulties which officials threw in his way,
he succeeded in loosening the chains and ameliorating
the treatment of the majority of the patients. Yet
his reforms nearly cost him his life. Rumours were
spread accusing him of some evil motive in unchaining
dangerous lunatics, and a mob one day seized him, and
uttered the well-known terrible cry “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la lanterne!</i>”
An old soldier of the French Guard, once a lunatic,
whom he had released from chains, cured, and employed
in his own service, was appropriately the means of his
rescue. Thus was philanthropy once more justified of
her children.</p>

<p>At this very period English public opinion had been
excited by revelations of cruelty and consequent deaths
in the old York Asylum. In 1791 a lady belonging
to the Society of Friends was placed in this asylum;
her friends were refused admission to visit her, and
in a few weeks she died. Inquiries that were made
showed great grounds for suspicion, although full
details could not be obtained.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But with great promptitude
William Tuke, a prominent Friend at York, whose
family has continued famous for attention to the affairs
of the insane, proposed early in 1792 the establishment
of a “Retreat” at York for insane patients, in which sympathy
should be substituted for unkindness, severity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>and stripes. The account given by Samuel Tuke in
1813 of its management is still a model in many
respects.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Neither Pinel nor the Tukes were however bold
enough entirely to dispense with mechanical coercion.
In 1818 Esquirol, the true successor of Pinel in France,
found maltreatment still generally prevalent in the
provincial asylums of France. In England mechanical
restraint continued to be largely employed till Conolly’s
time, and survives in some private asylums to the
present day. We cannot give further details on this
head, but hasten to mention the names of two men,
Dr. Charlesworth and Mr. Gardiner Hill, who must
ever be remembered as the first to give up mechanical
coercion entirely in the small asylum of Lincoln.
Dr. Charlesworth, physician to the asylum, had for
many years diligently watched the effects of mechanical
coercion, and gradually lessened the number of instruments
of restraint in the asylum. Finally, the total
disuse of mechanical restraints was decided on, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>put in practice by Mr. Gardiner Hill in 1836 in concert
with Dr. Charlesworth, with the most gratifying results.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We now come to the man who more than any other
in England may be said to have established the non-restraint
system so firmly that it will never be upset.
<span class="smcap">John Conolly</span> was born at Market Rasen in Lincolnshire,
in 1794. His father, a member of a good Irish
family, died young, and the care of a young family fell
on his widow, whose maiden name was Tennyson, and
whose patience and self-sacrifice her son ever affectionately
acknowledged as the main influence which led
to his own success. When his mother ultimately
married a French gentleman, a political emigré, the
latter taught his stepson French, and imbued him with
a genuine taste for and knowledge of the language.
Condillac’s essay “On the Origin of Human Knowledge”
influenced his mental life. While in his teens his
attention was first called to the subject of lunacy by
an inspection of the Glasgow Asylum, and he never
afterwards ceased to take the deepest interest in it.</p>

<p>At eighteen young Conolly became an officer in a
militia regiment, in which capacity he served several
years. While still young, he married in 1816 the
daughter of Sir John Collins and went to reside in
France, on the banks of the Loire. A year later he had
decided to enter the medical profession, and in 1817 became
a student at Edinburgh University. After a diligent
career, in the course of which he was one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
presidents of the Royal Medical Society, he graduated
M.D., and settled in practice as a physician at Chichester.
Here he became intimately acquainted with Dr. (afterwards
Sir John) Forbes, with whom he was afterwards
much connected in literary matters.</p>

<p>Dr. Conolly did not remain very long at Chichester,
but removed in 1823 to Stratford-on-Avon, where he
wrote many contributions to and took part in editing the
“Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,” and the <cite>British
and Foreign Medical Review</cite>. At Stratford he became
alderman and mayor, established a public dispensary,
and studied Shakespeare with enthusiasm. This occasioned
him afterwards, while practising at Warwick
in 1835, to take an active part as chairman of the
committee formed for securing the preservation of
Shakespeare’s tomb, and the restoration of the chancel
of the church.</p>

<p>In 1827 Dr. Conolly was appointed Professor of
the Practice of Medicine in London University, which
appointment he only held four years, finding life as
a London physician unsuitable to his tastes. In 1831
he again resorted to the country, establishing himself
in Warwick.</p>

<p>The subject of insanity had long engaged Dr.
Conolly’s attention. He had studied the question
both abroad and at home, and had been for five years,
(while residing at Stratford) inspecting physician to
the Lunatic Houses for the County of Warwick, an
office which he resumed when he settled in Warwick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
He had unsuccessfully proposed to the council of the
University that he should give his pupils clinical
instruction on insanity in one of the lunatic asylums
in London. “Thus,” says Sir James Clark,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “clinical
instruction in mental diseases was thrown back for
thirty years in this country.”</p>

<p>In 1830 Conolly published his valuable work, “An
Inquiry concerning the Indications of Insanity, with
Suggestions for the better Protection and Care of the
Insane.” His objects were to render the recognition
of insanity less difficult, by showing in what it differed
from those varieties of mind which approached nearest
to it; and to point out those circumstances which,
even in persons decidedly insane, could alone justify
various degrees of restraint. He lamented that during
a student’s career he only saw cases of insanity by
some rare accident. Every lunatic asylum was closed
to him, and yet when qualified he might any day have
to decide on a patient’s insanity. In view of some
recent revelations a quotation from the introduction to
this work (p. 3) is not inappropriate. “The timidity
or ignorance, or it may be, a dishonest motive, of
relatives, leads to exaggerated representations; and
the great profit accruing from a part of practice
almost separated from general medicine, cannot but
now and then operate against proper caution in admitting
such representations. When men’s interests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>depend upon an opinion, it is too much to expect
that opinion always to be cautiously formed, or even
in all cases honestly given. The most respectable
practitioners in this department openly justify the
authorising of restraint before the patient is seen,
and on the mere report of others; and it seems that
depositions to the insanity of individuals have been
received in courts of law, concerning persons with
whom the deponents have never had an interview;
and that on these depositions proceedings have been
partly founded, of which the results were the imprisonment
of lunatics, and restraint over their property.
When the affair is conducted with more formality,
and the suspected person is visited before being imprisoned,
those who visit him are often very little
acquainted with mental disorders, and come rather
to find proofs of his insanity, which, to minds pre-possessed,
are seldom wanting, than cautiously to
examine the state of his <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: mind.">mind</ins>.”</p>

<p>“If a person of sound mind were so visited, and knew
of the visit beforehand, it would not be quite easy for
him to comport himself, so as to avoid <em>conviction</em> that
he was <em>not</em> of sound mind. His indignation would
pass for raving; his moderation for the proverbial
cunning of a lunatic.”</p>

<p>After describing the condition of asylums and
lunatics at that time, the author considers the constitution
of the human understanding and the
inequalities, weaknesses, and peculiarities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> of mind which
do not amount to understanding, and the influence of
stimuli, of age, and of disease on the mind, and then
discusses the phenomena of insanity and the questions
of treatment and protection. He insists on the
necessity of the most scrutinising watchfulness over
the servants employed in their care. In cases where
patients would do themselves or others an injury he
insists on watching, instead of mechanical means of
restraint. He proposes a complete scheme for the
care of all lunatics by the State, providing for perfect
publicity of procedure. He finally points out the
increasing liability of the nervous system to disorganisation
owing to the increased pressure and more
varied anxieties of modern life, an observation most
fully justified by what has been established since
his day.</p>

<p>This work, a most readable and interesting one,
both to medical men and to general readers, was not
received with nearly sufficient warmth. Too many
were wedded to the old systems of treatment; too
many knew nothing about the diseases of the mind,
and their sympathy could not be aroused in favour
of lunatics. So Conolly was left to his country work
at Warwick, varied by one year’s residence at Birmingham,
till 1839, when he was appointed Resident
Physician to the Middlesex County Asylum at Hanwell,
at that time the largest in England. He had
taken the opportunity of visiting the Lincoln Asylum
and gaining all the advantages possible from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
experience. He was now satisfied that mechanical
restraint was not only unnecessary, but possibly injurious.
On few others had the non-restraint system
gained a hold. Hanwell had the reputation of being
one of the best-managed asylums in England, many
patients being occupied in agricultural and other
pursuits. Yet one year after Sir William Ellis’s resignation,
when Conolly took office, “instruments of
mechanical restraint of one kind or other were so
abundant in the wards as to amount, when collected
together, to about six hundred, about half of them
being handcuffs and leg-locks.”</p>

<p>Conolly entered upon his duties on the 1st June
1839. The asylum then contained 800 patients, and
he found forty under continuous mechanical restraint.
In his first report to the Quarter Sessions, he informed
the Justices that since the 21st of September not one
patient had been under restraint. “No form of strait
waistcoat, no handcuffs, no leg-locks, nor any contrivance
confining the trunk, or limbs, or any of the
muscles, is now in use. The coercion chairs, about
forty in number, have been altogether removed from
the wards.” In fact, they had been cut up to make a
floor for the carpenter’s shop.</p>

<p>This was not accomplished without some trouble and
anxiety. It took time to indoctrinate the officers and
attendants with the principles of the new system, in
which they were deprived of their old prop. The aid
which he received from Miss Powell the matron was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
most valuable. In ten years not one case was admitted
to Hanwell in which mechanical restraint was deemed
necessary, although many suicidal patients were among
them. In fact, the removal of restraint tended directly
and powerfully to promote the recovery of these, by
taking away the sense of degradation occasioned by
such restraint, by bringing them within the sphere of
medical remedial agents and of cheerful influences.
The only substitutes allowed were in some cases
seclusion of a patient in an ordinary sleeping apartment,
and, in extreme cases, in a padded room in
which the floor was a bed; such seclusion being
immediately reported to the medical officers, and
recorded, even when continued only for a few minutes.
This was found sufficient to protect the other patients,
to calm the refractory one, and act as a tonic and
remedial influence. The shower-bath was rarely resorted
to except for medical reasons; window-guards,
clothing, and bedding of strong materials to prevent
tearing, were only required in a few cases. “The great
and only real substitute for restraint is invariable kindness,”
says Dr. Conolly. “This feeling must animate
every person employed in every duty to be performed.”</p>

<p>Dr. Conolly published the main results of his
experience in his Clinical Lectures in the <cite>Lancet</cite> in
1846, and in a work on the Construction and Government
of Asylums, in 1847. His annual reports to
the Justices detailed the progress of his system, and
he afterwards summarised them and published them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
collectively. At the end of ten years, finding the non-restraint
system in no danger of being abandoned at
Hanwell, Dr. Conolly ceased to be resident physician,
and became visiting physician, attending at the asylum
twice a week, and spending the greater portion of the
day there. His interest in the patients, says Dr.
Hitchman, seemed never to flag. He would always
look out for something to commend in a patient, the
hair better kept, clothes more neatly worn, &amp;c., and
addressing the patients in the most gentle, affectionate
tones, he made his visits always a matter of longing.
The old attendants at the hospital in after years spoke
of Dr. Conolly’s untiring watchfulness in the first years
of his experiment. He would visit the wards at all
hours of the night to see that his orders were being
obeyed, walking noiselessly along the corridors. He
was kept up in his arduous duties by an elevated
religious principle. “I feel grateful to God,” he wrote,
“who has intrusted duties to me which angels might
stoop to perform.” He suffered greatly from an affection
of the skin, which kept him awake at night and ill at
ease during the day; and hence was liable to fits of
depression and irritability which sometimes made him
appear impatient.</p>

<p>In 1852, on his resignation of the appointment of
visiting physician, Conolly’s connection with Hanwell
practically ceased, and a piece of plate and his own
portrait by Sir W. Gordon were presented to him at a
public meeting by Lord Shaftesbury. In his reply on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
this occasion Dr. Conolly said: “Those who know me
well will believe me when I say there never was an
occasion when the sense of merit was less reflected
from the breast of the recipient of a public honour,
than it is from me at this moment.” He further
stated that when he had first heard of the establishment
of Hanwell Asylum, he was seized with a restless
desire to become one day its head.</p>

<p>Many objects of philanthropy had Dr. Conolly’s
untiring advocacy, both before and after his retirement
from Hanwell. Public middle-class lunatic asylums,
the education of medical men in mental diseases, the
establishment of idiot asylums, especially that at Earlswood,
were among these. He was the first doctor
applied to by Mrs. Plumbe in regard to the foundation
of Earlswood, and his co-operation with Dr. Andrew
Reed was of the most essential service to the enterprise.</p>

<p>Dr. Langdon Down, formerly Medical Superintendent
at Earlswood, wrote in regard to Conolly: “His
visits were the most refreshing incident of my recollection
in connection with the asylum. Entering on my
work (in 1858) as an untried man, and finding myself
allied to an institution which had become unpopular
at the Lunacy Board, I was mainly decided on holding
a position which had so much to overwhelm one by
the influence of Dr. Conolly. That influence was
magical. The humility of his character was only
equalled by the real love he manifested for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> mentally
afflicted.</p>

<p>“At the visits of the Board of Management, he
would steal away from his colleagues, and was to be
found holding loving intercourse with the little members
of my charge in a way that one has never seen
before or since. Moreover, he so encouraged every
official in his or her work, that the savour of his visit
lasted till he again returned.... For myself, I have
often had to seek his counsel, and never without being
struck with his judgment and the fascination of his
influence, the high resolve he inspired in one, and what
willingness he exhibited to maintain, co-equally with
the responsibility, the power of the Medical Superintendent,
and thus to prevent a repetition of those
evils which he had so bitterly to lament in his own
experience.”</p>

<p>The years after Conolly left Hanwell were busily
occupied with a large practice, especially in mental
cases. In a few years his unceasing labour told on
him, and he suffered much from chronic rheumatism
and neuralgia. Finally he was compelled to retire
from practice, when he took up his residence at Lawn
House, Hanwell, whence he could see the asylum in
which he had spent so many anxious hours. He
finally lost mental energy, and was unable to complete
several treatises and records of experience which he
was contemplating. He, however, left an enduring
memorial of his life-work in “The Treatment of the
Insane without Mechanical Restraints,” 1856, written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
in a most readable style. We must not omit to
mention his courses of lectures on Insanity at the
College of Physicians and at the Royal Institution,
his papers on Infantile Insanity, and finally “A Study
of Hamlet,” in which he brings the most skilfully
marshalled arguments to prove that Hamlet’s was a
real and not a feigned madness. As to Hamlet’s
treatment of Ophelia in Act II., Scene 1, and more
especially in the scene where Hamlet and Laertes met
over her grave, he remarked; “The picture of madness
here is too minutely true, its lights and shades are too
close to nature to have been painted as a mere illustration
of feigning, and of feigning without intelligible
purpose.” Both Sir Theodore and Lady Martin (Miss
Helen Faucit) considered his exposition most satisfactory,
and that it settled the question finally.</p>

<p>Conolly was carried off, after years of weakness, by
an attack of paralysis with convulsions, which was
fatal in a few hours, on March 5, 1867. Few have
left behind them a brighter record as physician and
philanthropist.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Improvement in the treatment of the insane and
the knowledge of mental diseases has progressed
rapidly in late years, owing to the efforts and studies
of many workers, among whom Drs. Bucknill, Tuke,
Hood, Lockhart Robinson, and Forbes Winslow are
conspicuous. The record of their work would lead us
into too wide a field. But the life-work of one of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>the
sons-in-law of Dr. Conolly, <span class="smcap">Henry Maudsley</span>, is of a
character which for good or ill has exerted, and is
exerting, a powerful influence on younger minds. We
come here into a region of work influenced by the
philosophy of Darwin and Herbert Spencer, applied
to the physiology and pathology of mind, and to the
relationship between body and mind. The time is not
yet come for an impartial estimate of the striking
works which Dr. Maudsley has brought forth in fertile
succession, in addition to his extensive labours as one
of the editors of the <cite>Journal of Mental Science</cite>. But
it is certain that every one who would place himself in
a position to estimate the strength of the so-called
“materialistic” school, whether he be a metaphysician,
a doctor, or a person of average culture, must read Dr.
Maudsley’s works. They are written fearlessly, and
for the most part with admirable lucidity, displaying
a knowledge of literature and philosophy not often
met with, combined with great practical experience in
mental phenomena.</p>

<p>Henry Maudsley was born near Giggleswick, in
Yorkshire, on February 5, 1835. After receiving his
early education at Giggleswick School, he proceeded to
University College, London, and took the M.B. degree
at London University in 1856, with the distinction of
University Scholar in Medicine. He proceeded to the
M.D. degree in 1857. During the years 1859-1862
he was Resident Physician to the Manchester Royal
Lunatic Hospital. Returning later to London he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
became for a time Professor of Medical Jurisprudence
at his old college, and later Consulting Physician to
the West London Hospital.</p>

<p>In an article on “The Theory of Vitality,” which
Dr. Maudsley published in the <cite>British and Foreign
Medico-Chirurgical Review</cite> in 1863 (republished in
“Body and Mind,” 1870), he showed remarkable power
for a young man of twenty-eight. His conclusion was
that the conscious mind of man blends in unity of
development with the unconscious life of nature. He
looked for the harmonisation of the idealism of Plato
and the realism of Bacon as the expressions of the
same truths.</p>

<p>In 1867 Dr. Maudsley published an important work
on the Physiology and Pathology of Mind. It was
intended to treat of mental phenomena from a physiological
rather than from a metaphysical point of view
and secondly, to bring the manifold instructive instances
presented by the unsound mind to bear upon
the interpretation of the obscure problems of mental
science, and to do what he could to put an end to the
inauspicious divorce between the two branches of his
subject. He energetically exposed the shortcomings of
psychologists and metaphysicians, and naturally encountered
severe criticism, and it may be allowed
that some of his expressions were those of youthful
enthusiasm rather than of matured wisdom. But the
book had such merits, that a second edition was called
for in the next year, and before long exhausted, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
which the book was out of print for some years.</p>

<p>At length Dr. Maudsley republished in a modified
form the “Physiology of Mind” in a separate volume of
550 pages (1876), putting it forward as a disquisition,
by the light of existing knowledge, concerning the
nervous structures and functions which are the probable
physical foundations of those natural phenomena,
which appear in consciousness, or feelings,
and thoughts. In this work he says (p. 47) “that
the subjective method—the method of interrogating
self-consciousness—is not adequate to the construction
of a true mental science has now seemingly been
sufficiently established. That is not to say that it is
worthless; for when not strained beyond its capabilities,
its results must, in the hands of competent men,
be as useful as they are indispensable.... That
which a just reflection teaches incontestably, the present
state of physiology illustrates practically. Though
very imperfect as a science, physiology has made
sufficient progress to prove that no psychology can
endure except it be based upon its investigations.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. Maudsley had been called upon in
1870 to deliver the Gulstonian Lectures at the College
of Physicians, and these were published in a small
book under the title “Body and Mind: an Inquiry
into their Connection and Mutual Influence, specially
in Reference to Mental Disorders.” The first lecture
expounded the physical conditions of mental function
in health; the second described some forms of mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
degeneracy which showed prominently the operation
of physical causes from generation to generation, and
the relationship of mental disorders to other diseases
of the nervous system. The third included a general
survey of the pathology of the mind, and the relations
of morbid states of body to disordered mental function.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some important medico-legal cases had
brought into prominence Dr. Maudsley’s belief that
there are many forms of mental disease in which a
patient ought not to be held criminally responsible
for his actions, although he might be fully cognisant of
their nature. This was definitely expressed as far back
as 1864 in a pamphlet entitled “Insanity and Crime,”
a medico-legal commentary on the case of George
Victor Townley, by the editors of the <cite>Journal of
Mental Science</cite>. It was in 1872 more fully developed
by Dr. Maudsley in his “Responsibility in Mental
Disease,” which has gone through numerous editions.</p>

<p>In 1879 the “Pathology of Mind” appeared in a
separate and enlarged form, and contains a systematic
exposition of the subject, introduced by an account
of sleep, dreaming, somnambulism, and allied states.
He then proceeds to deal with the causation of insanity,
both social and material, and then further
expounds the symptoms of insanity, treating it as
one disease with varied manifestations, and then delineating
the clinical groups of mental disorders met with
in practice and which the physician has to deal with.
One great merit of the book is, that the clinical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
pictures it contains are drawn from life. An extract
from chapter iv., dealing with the influence of conditions
of life on the production of insanity, will show
how at every step Dr. Maudsley introduces considerations
bearing on morality.</p>

<p>“The maxims of morality which were proclaimed by
holy men of old as lessons of religion indispensable to
the well-being and stability of families and nations, are
not really wild dreams of inspired fancy, nor the empty
words which preachers make them; founded on a sincere
recognition of the laws of nature working in human
events, they were visions of eternal truths of human
evolution. Assuredly the ‘everlasting arms’ are beneath
the upright man who dealeth uprightly, but they
are the everlasting laws of nature which sustain him
who, doing that which is lawful and right, leads a life
that is in faithful harmony with the laws of nature’s
progress; the destruction which falls upon him who
dealeth treacherously and doeth iniquity, ‘observing
not the commandments of the Lord to obey them,’ are
the avenging consequences of broken natural laws.
How long will it be before men perceive and acknowledge
the eternity of action, good or ill, and feel the
keen sense of responsibility, and the strong sentiment
of duty which so awful a reflection is fitted to engender?
How long before they realise vividly that under
the reign of law on earth sin or error is inexorably
avenged, as virtue is indicated, in its consequences,
and take to heart the lesson that they are determining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
in their generation what shall be predetermined in the
constitution of the generation after them?”</p>

<p>A later important work is “Body and Will,” 1883.
“Its justification from my standpoint,” says Dr.
Maudsley, “is, that I have been engaged all my life in
dealing with mind in its concrete human embodiments,
and that in order to find out why individuals feel,
think, and do differently, and in what way best to deal
with them so as to do one’s duty to oneself and to them,
I have had no choice but to leave the barren heights
of speculation for the plains on which men live and
move and have their being. It is not enough to think
and talk about abstract minds and their qualities when
you have to do with concrete minds that must be
observed, and studied, and managed.”</p>

<p>This work deals with questions too vast to be summarily
discussed; but one aspect of Dr. Maudsley’s
mind is well expounded in the following extract:—</p>

<p>“In nature, as we see it, we seem to see a conflict
of warring opposites; gravitation opposed, or rather
indeed complemented, by repulsion; chemical affinities
by chemical repulsions; magnetic attraction by electric
repulsion; evolution by dissolution; conservation by
revolution, quiet or catastrophic; love by hate; self-love
by love of kind; heaven by hell. Certain it is
that hate and destruction are just as necessary agents
as love and production in nature, which could no more
be, or be conceived to be, without the one than without
the other; and to call the one good more than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
other, however necessary from the standpoint of human
egoism, is just as if one were to call gravitation good
and repulsion bad, as gravitation, had it self-consciousness,
would no doubt do. In order to have a theory of
cosmogony that shall cover all the facts, it has always
been necessary to supplement a good principle by a
bad principle, a God of love and creation by a God of
hate and destruction. And it must always be so. We
may, agreeably to the logic of our wishes, comfort ourselves
in our pilgrimage by entertaining the hope and
belief of the working out of good through evil and of
the permanence of good after the disappearance of evil,
just as, if it were useful and pleasing to us to cherish
the illusion, we might persuade ourselves that repulsion
will one day be annihilated and gravitation endure, or
that evolution will continue and dissolution cease to be;
but if we look at the matter in the cold spirit of strictly
rational inquiry we shall always find abundant reason
to believe that the sum of the respective energies of
good and evil remains a constant quantity, the respective
distribution only varying, and that we might as well
try to increase the height of the mountain without increasing
the depth of the valley, as to increase the
good in the world by purging it of its so-called evil.”</p>

<p>Dr. Maudsley became a Fellow of the College of
Physicians in 1869, has been President of the Medico-Psychological
Association, and received the LL.D.
degree from Edinburgh University in 1884.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Specialisation</span> is decreed by the will of the public
as much as by that of the practitioner. This is
true of many professions besides those of medicine.
Although the general discernment has always recognised
the ability of men with powers of the universal
type, these men are rare, and there is a strong
tendency to believe that a man cannot be master of the
whole field of a science, but may more probably be
master of a portion of it. Again, with hawk eye the
people who want to be cured of disease mark and then
swoop down upon men who appear to them specially
capable in one department of medical practice, and no
denunciation of specialism, no drawing back on the
part of the physician, will avail against this natural
selection. The man to whom crowds of patients of
one kind flock naturally becomes specially skilled in
dealing with them: and it is impossible to stem the
tide by saying that such ought not to be the case.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>
<p>Specialism has been carried to a surprising extent
in America, when Dr. Morell Mackenzie informs us, in
his article on “Specialism in Medicine,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> it would be
almost impossible to find a city with ten thousand
inhabitants in which there are not three or four specialists;
whilst in a city of one hundred and thirty
thousand inhabitants, thirteen specialists were found
exclusively engaged in treating throat diseases.</p>

<p>The days of encyclopædic knowledge may be past,
but the need of a broad, general, scientific, and professional
education for the medical man, even a
specialist, will never cease. If, as Dr. Mackenzie says,
the leviathans of omniscience loom dim and gigantic,
like the megatherium and mastodon of remote geological
periods, and if the type is as utterly extinct as he
believes, it is all the more incumbent on the guides of
medical instruction to see that their pupils pass through
a broad course of study which shall fairly represent
the achievements of the past and the main features of
the knowledge of the present. <span class="smcap">Erasmus Wilson</span> was
a man who undoubtedly gained a good record in
general professional knowledge, and knew well the
anatomy and physiology of his student days.</p>

<p>William James Erasmus Wilson, son of William
Wilson, surgeon, a native of Aberdeen, in early life a
naval surgeon, who later settled at Dartford and Greenhithe
in Kent, was born on November 25, 1809, in High
Street, Marylebone, where his maternal grandfather,
Erasmus Bronsdorph, a Norwegian by birth, resided.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>He was educated at Dartford Grammar School and
at Swanscombe, but very soon commenced practical
medical work under his father in the parish infirmary.
At the early age of sixteen he was sent to London to
enter John Abernethy’s anatomical class, and there is
no doubt that his teacher’s individuality powerfully
impressed him. But among his friends were some who
led his tastes also somewhat deeply into botany and
zoology, entomological facts then learnt being destined
to bear fruit in his Commentary on Diseases of the Skin.</p>

<p>Wilson was enabled to extend his studies to Paris in
1828 and in 1830, where he attended Cuvier’s and
Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s lectures, and among others saw
the practice of Dupuytren, Orfila, and Lisfranc. He
became noted for his neat dissections, insomuch that
he was nicknamed the “piocheur,” or “sap” in English
slang. To his excellence in dissection young Wilson
joined an equal faculty for drawing, derived from his
mother.</p>

<p>In 1826 young Wilson had become a resident pupil
with Mr. Langstaff, father of a fellow-student, surgeon
to the parish infirmary of Cripplegate. Here in Langstaff’s
dissecting-room, where many pathological researches
were carried on, Wilson made the acquaintance
of numerous men of mark who resorted thither, including
Jones Quain and William Lawrence. On the establishment
of the Aldersgate School of Medicine under
Lawrence’s régime, Wilson joined it as student, and in
1829-30 won both the surgical and the midwifery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
prizes. On the day when he attained his majority,
November 25, 1830, Wilson took the Apothecaries’
Hall diploma.</p>

<p>Having become a member of the London College of
Surgeons in 1831, Wilson was asked by Dr. Jones Quain,
then Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at University
College, London, to be his assistant, and he soon after
was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy under Richard
Quain. Wilson was a capital teacher of anatomy, and
his private museum of dissections prepared by his own
hands fully illustrated his manipulative capacity. He
superintended the execution of the illustrations to the
celebrated Quain’s Anatomy, and also those to Liston’s
Practical Surgery (1837).</p>

<p>When Dr. Jones Quain retired from University
College Hospital in 1838, Wilson resigned his appointments
also, and established a school of anatomy under
the title of Sydenham College, which however did not
prove ultimately successful. He then devoted himself
to such private practice as he could obtain in Charlotte
Street, Fitzroy Square, eking out his income by taking
pupils, and by literary work. In 1838 he appeared as
an author with “The Dissector’s Manual of Practical
and Surgical Anatomy,” subsequently producing the
“Anatomist’s Vade Mecum” (1840), of which many editions
have been called for. In the same year he became
Lecturer on Anatomy and Physiology at the
Middlesex Hospital.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile Wilson had made the acquaintance of
a man who was destined to turn his thoughts in the
direction which became permanent. His father, after
retiring from the navy, had taken a mansion at Deham,
Bucks, and set up a private lunatic asylum; and in
connection with this establishment Wilson met Mr.
Thomas Wakley, M.P., the founder of the <cite>Lancet</cite>, and
coroner for Middlesex. Mr. Wakley appointed Wilson
sub-editor of the <cite>Lancet</cite> in 1840, a post which he held
for several years, continuing to write for that journal
after resigning the more onerous post when his private
practice increased. About this time he became Consulting
Surgeon to the Marylebone Infirmary, and
gained a very extensive experience of every department
of hospital surgery. In fact, it appeared at first
that Wilson would probably make his mark as a pure
surgeon.</p>

<p>No more certain path, however, opening in this
direction, Mr. Wakley considerably influenced Wilson
towards choosing a special line of practice as a means
of success. There was much open opposition at that
time among medical men to the idea of specialisation,
and Mr. Wakley succeeded in overcoming Wilson’s fear
of sinking under the dreaded name of quack. The
choice of a specialty was not difficult, as skin diseases
or dermatology then constituted an almost uncultivated
field. “I have never regretted my choice,” he
remarked on one occasion;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> “there is only one more
beautiful thing in the world than a fine healthy skin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>and that is a rare skin disease.”</p>

<p>In 1842 Wilson brought out his extended systematic
work on Diseases of the Skin, and subsequently produced
twelve fasciculi of folio “Portraits of Diseases
of the Skin.” In connection with these we may mention
that he took a large share in the well-known
five volumes of Anatomical Plates, issued jointly by
Dr. Quain and himself. In 1843 he was elected a
Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and in 1844 a
Fellow of the Royal Society, having contributed to
the latter a memoir on a newly-discovered parasite
on the human skin, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Entozoon folliculorum</i>
. He
made himself familiar with varieties of skin diseases
by extensive vacation rambles—in Switzerland and
the Valais studying goitre, in Italy searching out
ringworm cases among the peasantry, in the East
making leprosy a special object of inquiry. He wrote
the article “Skin” in Cooper’s Surgical Dictionary, a
Report on Leprosy, and many articles on various subjects
connected with the specialty.</p>

<p>Thus Wilson became a specialist of great merit as
well as profitable practice, and, says the <cite>Lancet</cite> (August
16, 1884), “knew more about skin diseases than any
man of his time. He cured when others had failed
to cure; and his works on dermatology, though they
met with pretty searching criticism at the time of
their appearance, have nearly all maintained their
position as text-books. The horrible cases of scrofula,
anæmia, and blood-poisoning which he witnessed among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
the poor of London—they are happily rarer now than
they were half a century ago—enlisted his warm sympathies.
But he had to deal with rich patients as well
as poor, and over these the masterful stamp of his
mind enabled him to exercise despotism in matters of
diet. Wilson was not only a consummate dietician,
but he knew how to make his patients submit to
have their bodies placed under martial law.” He in
fact largely viewed skin diseases as expressions of
internal derangement and constitutional defects. He
was continually on the look out for deficiency of nutrition
in children and remedying it.</p>

<p>Wilson was much pleased to be the means of bringing
forward a little work on “Infant Life: its Nurture
and Care,” written anonymously by a lady, and first
published in his “Journal of Cutaneous Medicine.” In
the preface which he wrote to it he expresses his
strong beliefs that hygiene is the first necessity of a
scholastic institution, that with proper nurture almost
all the diseases of infants would be extinguished, that
illness following vaccination properly performed can
only occur owing to neglect of proper nurture and
care, and that “healthy children never suffer, never
die from vaccination.”</p>

<p>An incident which brought Erasmus Wilson prominently
before the public was the inquest held at
Hounslow on a soldier who had died after a regimental
flogging. Mr. Wakley held the inquest, which lasted
eleven days. It was in a great measure owing to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Wilson’s decided evidence that a verdict was returned
declaring that the flogging had been the cause of death.
The public feeling was aroused, a Parliamentary inquiry
was subsequently held, and the punishment of
flogging was at last removed from the regimental code.</p>

<p>Several works of considerable merit made Wilson’s
name very widely known. One of the most popular
of these was entitled “Healthy Skin,” first published
in 1845. It strongly advocated that constant use of
the bath which has become far more prevalent than
when it was first issued. A translation of Hufeland’s
“Art of Prolonging Life,” which he edited, appeared in
1853. In “The Eastern or Turkish Bath,” in 1861,
Wilson gave a powerful impetus to the establishment
and spread of the Turkish bath in England, and laid
down principles and plans of procedure calculated to
make this bath safe for persons of very varied constitutions.</p>

<p>In 1869 Erasmus Wilson founded at his own cost
a museum and professorship of dermatology at the
College of Surgeons, with an endowment of £5000,
and was appointed the first professor. In this capacity
he lectured for nearly ten years. Several successive
series of lectures were published, as well as a catalogue
of the museum. He was also the founder of the Chair
of Pathology in Aberdeen University. He also endowed
a pathological curatorship at the College of
Surgeons. He was elected on the Council of the
College in 1870, and was President in 1881. A <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>special
grant of an honorary gold medal was made to him by
the College in 1884, just before his death.</p>

<p>His early Eastern travels had particularly interested
Wilson in Egyptology, and he became by wide reading
and study very competent in Egyptian lore, as is
evidenced by his “Egypt of the Past,” published in
1881. His munificence in connection with the bringing
of the obelisk known as “Cleopatra’s Needle” to
London in 1877-8 is a familiar story. Many abortive
proposals had been made to secure its being brought to
England, but Government had always failed to make
any arrangement. General Sir James Alexander was
the means of starting the idea in Erasmus Wilson’s
mind, by speaking to him of a project for raising sufficient
money by a general subscription. Wilson, who
was greatly interested, thought the sum needed, £10,000,
would not be forthcoming, and undertook to pay the
entire sum himself, Mr. John Dixon, C.E., having
undertaken its successful transport. Thus Britons will
ever owe to him the possession of this choice treasure
of Egyptian antiquity. The book entitled “Cleopatra’s
Needle: with Brief Notes on Egypt and Egyptian
Obelisks,” which Wilson brought out in 1877, went
through several editions.</p>

<p>But these were only a few of the public objects to
which Erasmus Wilson devoted his wealth, which had
been vastly increased by singularly skilful investments
in gas and railway companies’ shares. He restored
Swanscombe Church, near his birthplace, in 1873. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>He
founded, at a cost of £2500, a scholarship at the Royal
College of Music, besides contributing considerably to
its general funds. He was a large subscriber to the
Royal Medical Benevolent College at Epsom, and built
at his own cost a house for the head-master; further,
he built at a cost of £30,000 a new wing and chapel
for the Sea-Bathing Infirmary at Margate, in which
skin diseases are largely treated. He was a strong
Freemason, and contributed liberally to various Masonic
charities. In recognition of his many public benefactions
he was knighted in 1881.</p>

<p>“From his earliest life,” says the <cite>British Medical
Journal</cite> (August 16, 1884), “he was characterised particularly
by his kindliness and gentleness of manner,
which made him many friends; indeed, to know him was
to love him. His generosity to poor patients who came
to consult him was very great, not only prescribing for
them gratis, but supplying the means for carrying out
the treatment, and that not only after he became
wealthy, but even at a time when he could ill afford
to be generous. The amount of good he did privately
will probably never be known, as he was one of whom
it may truly be said, that he never let his left hand
know what his right hand did—so unostentatious was
he in regard to his charity.”</p>

<p>Sir Erasmus Wilson had been in ill-health for two
years before his death, and for a year was quite blind,
yet never lost cheerfulness. On July 23, 1884, he was
at the consecration of St. Saviour’s Church at Westgate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
on Sea, of which he had laid the foundation-stone a
year before. Within three days he became seriously
ill, and died on August 7th. He had married in 1841
a Miss Doherty, who survived him. He left no family,
and the bulk of his property, something like £180,000,
reverts on Lady Wilson’s death to the College of
Surgeons, without any restriction as to the disposal of
the fund. Other legacies of £5000 each he bequeathed
to the Sea-Bathing Infirmary at Margate, the Medical
Benevolent College, and the Society for the Relief of
the Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. Such bequests
alone would place a man among great public
benefactors. Wilson had not waited till death came
before he became beneficent, and if his gifts are used
in the spirit in which he gave them, he will rank with
John Hunter as to the material if not the intellectual
legacy he has bequeathed to mankind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Descended from an old Scotch family (the Mackenzies
of Scutwell), Dr. <span class="smcap">Morell Mackenzie</span> is the son of the
late Mr. Stephen Mackenzie, surgeon, of Leytonstone,
by his wife Margaret, daughter of Mr. Adam Harvey of
Lewes. Morell Mackenzie was born at Leytonstone,
on the borders of Epping Forest, on the 7th July 1837.
His father was a man of exceptional intellectual power,
whose studies took the direction of metaphysics and
mental diseases; hence he acquired great skill in treating
nervous affections which border on insanity. His
ability was testified to by Mr. Brudenell Carter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> in his
valuable essay on Hysteria (see p. <a href="#Page_268">268</a>). Mrs. Mackenzie
was a clever woman of a highly practical tendency.
The untimely death of Stephen Mackenzie in 1851,
when he was thrown out of his gig and killed on the
spot, left his widow with nine children very slenderly
provided for.</p>

<p>Morell Mackenzie was educated by Dr. Greig of
Walthamstow, many of whose pupils entered the service
of the East India Company. Mackenzie always took
a great interest in natural history, in which he was
largely encouraged by his mother, and from an early
period greatly desired to enter the medical profession.
But a medical education being then beyond the means
of the family so suddenly bereaved, he was placed at
the age of sixteen in the office of the Union Assurance
Company in Cornhill. Here he got on very well, but
never abandoned the hope of becoming a doctor.
Fortunately, by the kind aid of a relative, he was
enabled to gratify this desire, and he accordingly resigned
his clerkship, and became a student at the
London Hospital.</p>

<p>On commencing his medical studies Mackenzie determined
to take his degree at the University of
London, combining with his hospital work the preparation
for matriculation. Having become a member of
the College of Surgeons in 1858, he subsequently took
the M.B. degree with high honours in three subjects.
At the London Hospital he obtained the senior gold
medal for surgery, and the gold medal for zeal, talent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
and humanity to the patients, awarded by the governors.
On leaving the hospital he went to Paris, where he
studied for a year under Trousseau, Nélaton, Ricord,
and others. He spent another year in Vienna, where
he studied pathology under Rokitansky, chest diseases
under Skoda, skin affections under Hebra, and diseases
of the eye under Arlt and Jäger. During his stay at
Vienna Mackenzie made an expedition to Pesth in
order to become acquainted with the laryngoscope, an
instrument invented by Manuel Garcia, which Czermak
was then beginning to use. A friendship sprang up
between these two men which only terminated with
Czermak’s lamented death. Czermak was very desirous
that Mackenzie should translate some of his
papers and publish them in the English medical
journals, but he had determined to study for a few
months in Italy, and before he returned home Czermak
had himself come over to London and introduced the
laryngoscope into England. On arriving in London
Mackenzie was at once appointed Resident Medical
Officer at the London Hospital, and shortly afterwards
Registrar to that institution. He now began to make
daily studies with the laryngoscope, and soon published
cases in the medical journals which had been treated
by its aid. In 1862 he completed the M.D. degree
at London University.</p>

<p>In 1863 the Jacksonian prize for an essay on the
Diseases of the Larynx was awarded to Mackenzie by
the Royal College of Surgeons, and on the urgent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
advice of many of his medical friends, especially that
of the late Dr. Herbert Davies, he determined to make
throat diseases a specialty, and having established
himself in practice in the West End, he was largely instrumental
in founding the Throat Hospital in King
Street, Golden Square, in the same year. In 1866
Dr. Mackenzie was appointed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Assistant Physician">Assistant-Physician</ins> to
the London Hospital, and his colleagues subsequently
offered to recommend to the committee of that institution
that a department for throat diseases should be
established under his supervision. This however he declined,
on the ground that he wished to treat diseases
of every kind whilst attached to the London Hospital.
He, however, gave a course of lectures on Throat Diseases
at the London Hospital Medical College, whilst he also
lectured on Physiology for three years. Dr. Mackenzie
was afterwards obliged, owing to his increasing practice,
to resign his connection with the London Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie has for many years occupied a prominent
position not only as a specialist but as a
champion of specialism, and has exhibited considerable
persistence in his advocacy of any cause with which
the interests of specialism were connected. Some
years ago, when most of the special hospitals were
excluded from participation in the London Hospital
Sunday Fund, Dr. Morell Mackenzie led the attack
upon the position taken up by the committee, with
the result that the treasurer of the Fund resigned, and
a modification of procedure took place. Dr. Mackenzie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
among the other honorary memberships of foreign
societies which have been conferred upon him, is one
of the two honorary Fellows of the American Laryngological
Association, Signor Garcia being the other.
He has invented a number of instruments or modifications
of instruments for the treatment of throat
diseases, and has written copiously on the subject.
His principal works are entitled “On the Use of the
Laryngoscope in Diseases of the Throat,” “Essays on
Throat Diseases,” “Diphtheria,” “Hay Fever,” and
“Diseases of the Throat and Nose.” He has also
written the article on Diseases of the Larynx in
Reynolds’s “System of Medicine.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morell Mackenzie claims that his experience as
to diseases of the throat amply justifies and necessitates
specialism. “The scientific literature relating to these,”
he says (<cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, June 1885), “dates from
little more than twenty-five years back, and already it
has grown to a bulk that would surfeit the voracity of the
most persevering bookworm, and it goes on increasing
and multiplying in a manner that makes one long for
a Malthus to preach some degree of moderation to its
producers. Every week, every day brings one books,
pamphlets, articles, lectures, reprints about all sorts
of uncomfortable things in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">itis</i>
 and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">osis</i>
, as seen in the
throats of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians,
Danes, Russians, Americans, and all the other offspring
of Babel. A certain proportion of these, no doubt,
are of great value, but not a few might be consigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
to the wastepaper basket without serious loss to
science; all must be read, however, lest some grains
of wheat should be thrown away with the chaff.
Several periodicals dealing exclusively with diseases
of the throat appear with praiseworthy regularity;
and there are also societies, associations, &amp;c., founded
for the same purpose, each of which, of course, issues
its yearly volume of Transactions.... This may give
some faint idea of the herculean labour which the
specialist who wishes to keep abreast of the progress
of knowledge in his own subject from the literary
point of view alone has to undergo; and it must be
remembered that in medicine reading is after all only
subsidiary to the practical work by which skill is perfected
and experience gathered and extended.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The subject of animal parasites upon and in the
human body, while certainly not one of the most
attractive on a superficial view, has yet been found to
yield scientific material of the highest interest, and has
required great energy and care to produce satisfactory
results. Among British workers in this field none is
more widely known than Dr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Spencer Cobbold</span>,
F.R.S.</p>

<p>Dr. Cobbold is the third son of the late Rev. Richard
Cobbold, rector of Wortham, Suffolk, the author of the
striking “History of Margaret Catchpole,” and his
grandmother, Mrs. Cobbold, was a zealous geological
collector in the early days of geology, having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
fossil species of mollusc (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nucula Cobboldiæ</i>
) named in
her honour. The subject of this notice was born at
Ipswich in 1828, and educated for some years by the
Rev. H. Burrows, at Yarmouth, and afterwards at the
Charterhouse.</p>

<p>Young Cobbold entered upon the study of medicine
at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital in 1844, as pupil
of Mr. Crosse, F.R.S. Later he proceeded to Edinburgh,
and became class-assistant to Professor Hughes Bennett,
and prosector to Professor Goodsir, then at the height
of his career. Such men, and especially Goodsir,
exercised a great awakening influence on young
Cobbold, and deepened his strong tendencies towards
anatomical research. In 1851 Dr. Cobbold graduated
on the same day as Dr. Burdon-Sanderson, now
Waynflete Professor of Physiology at Oxford, and the
late Dr. Charles Murchison, all three being gold-medallists.
After studying for some time in Paris, Dr.
Cobbold on his return to Edinburgh was appointed
curator of the Anatomical Museum, and became active
in dissecting specimens of animals received at the
museum. Among others his memoir on the giraffe
and other ruminants formed the basis of his article
Ruminantia, contributed to Todd and Bowman’s
Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology. When the
lamented Edward Forbes was elected to the chair of
Natural History, Dr. Cobbold’s attention was powerfully
attached to geology, and for some years he made
excursions with his class, and collected large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>numbers
of fossils. More distant excursions to Arran, the Yorkshire
and Devonshire coasts, the Isle of Wight, &amp;c.,
supplied Dr. Cobbold with specimens of great service
in illustrating the Swiney Lectures, which he afterwards
delivered for five years with marked success
at the British Museum and at the Royal School of
Mines (1868-72). So popular did these lectures become
that towards the close of the last course many
of the visitors could not find seats.</p>

<p>After the death of Edward Forbes, Dr. Cobbold
resigned his appointments in Edinburgh, and became
Lecturer on Botany at St. Mary’s Hospital. Two years
later he transferred his services to the Middlesex
Hospital, lecturing there for thirteen years on Zoology
and Comparative Anatomy. During his connection
with the Middlesex Hospital he took up the branch
of zoology and medicine with which his name will be
most distinctively associated. During three successive
years he examined the bodies of animals dying at the
Zoological Gardens, especially with a view to discovering
the presence of parasitic worms in them. Many
papers were contributed by him to the Linnean and
Zoological Transactions and Proceedings, among which
we may call attention to “Remarks on all the Human
Entozoa” (Zool. Soc. Proc., 1862).</p>

<p>In 1864 Dr. Cobbold was elected F.R.S., and in the
same year published his “Introductory Treatise on
the Entozoa,” which established his reputation, the
<cite>Lancet</cite> declaring that it formed a noble contribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> to
medical science and a credit to our national literature.
Up to the year 1865 Dr. Cobbold persevered in the
pursuit of pure science, refusing all inducements to
practice; but finding that after his twenty years of
zealous labour, no suitable scientific post opened for
him, he at length commenced practice in Wimpole
Street, removing later to Harley Street. Here his great
knowledge of the habits and treatment of internal worm
parasites became available for professional purposes,
and his services were largely sought. But scientific
pursuits and public lecturing still claimed his attention,
and among the achievements of his later years
are his book on Tapeworms, which has gone through
several editions; his lectures on practical helminthology,
entitled “Worms;” a manual of the “Parasites
of the Domesticated Animals,” a larger treatise on
Parasites, a smaller supplementary work on Human
Parasites. In 1873 Dr. Cobbold received the appointment
of Professor of Botany at the Royal Veterinary
College, and soon afterwards a special chair of helminthology
was established for him at the College, for giving
instruction on the parasites and parasitic diseases of
domesticated animals to veterinary students. In connection
with this work. Dr. Cobbold went still more
deeply into the parasitic diseases of domestic animals,
such as those which caused grouse disease, ostrich
and pigeon epidemics, gapes in chickens, &amp;c. He
delivered a course of lectures on the “Parasites of
Animals employed as Food” at the Society of Arts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
He has been the first to describe many new species of
internal worms from elephants, horses, cattle, sheep,
and dogs. One of the most elaborate of his special
memoirs is that in which he has described the parasites
of elephants, in the Linnean Society’s Transactions.
With these extensive researches in comparative
anatomy, Dr. Cobbold has not neglected human parasites
of late years, and various papers and lectures of
his have commanded much attention and elucidated
important points. He contributed fifty short articles
on these subjects to Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine.”
As a lecturer Dr. Cobbold’s style is highly popular and
pleasing. He possesses to a great degree the power
of putting himself on good terms with his audience
and keeping them interested. His position in regard
to the investigations with which his life has been
chiefly occupied has been quite unique.</p>

<p>An extract from his work on Entozoa is an interesting
example of a very successful mode of treating
this subject. “The happiest, and perhaps after all
the most truly philosophic, way of studying the entozoa,
is to regard them as a peculiar fauna, destined to
occupy an equally peculiar territory. That territory
is the widespread domain of the interior of the bodies
of man and animals. Each animal or “host” may be
regarded as a continent, and each part or viscus of his
body may be noted as a district. Each district has its
special attractions for particular parasitic forms; yet,
at the same time, neither the district nor the continent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
are suitable localities as a permanent resting-place for
the invader. None of the internal parasites ‘continue
in one stay;’ all have a tendency to roam; migration
is the very soul of their prosperity; change of residence
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i>
 of their existence, whilst a blockade
in the interior, prolonged beyond the proper period,
terminates only in cretification and death.”</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> eye, the organ of light, was, till recent times,
practically a dark chamber. Only its grosser movements
and the effects of its lenses upon the rays of
light were understood. Its minute structure, its relationship
to the brain, and the real nature of the morbid
changes occurring in it, were hidden. To-day its microscopic
elements are unravelled, and very much is known
of their connexion with the great nerve-centres behind
them. Experiment and calculation have gone far to
settle the precise mode in which light gives rise to
sight, and affects our perception and judgment of
external objects, and the condition of the eye during
life and health or disease has been brought into view
by the ophthalmoscope. The names of Helmholtz and
of Donders are inseparably connected with modern
advances in the physiology of the eye, while no
English name is more conspicuous in regard to the
surgery of the eye than that with which we commence
this chapter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Willliam">William</ins> Bowman</span>, the third son of Mr. J. Eddowes
Bowman, banker, of Nantwich, and afterwards of
Welshpool and Wrexham, was born at Nantwich on
July 20, 1816. He was early surrounded by scientific
associations, for his father was a botanist and
geologist of wide cultivation, having formed a very
complete herbarium of British plants, and having furnished
to Sir Roderick Murchison valuable original
matter for his “Silurian System.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman placed his son at Hazelwood School,
Birmingham, which Sir Rowland Hill’s father was conducting
on the principle of the abolition of corporal
punishment. The boys largely governed themselves,
printing a magazine of their own. They were taught
natural science too, a very unusual thing in those
days. In such a congenial atmosphere young Bowman
flourished, and in time became head boy.</p>

<p>An accident to one of his hands, about the close of
his school course, seems to have led to Mr. Bowman’s
choice of surgery as a profession. For some months
he saw country practice with Mr. T. T. Griffith, of
Wrexham, seeing a good deal of cholera, which was
then prevailing, and spending his leisure in copying
anatomical drawings of the human bones and muscles.
He then became, through the interest of Mr. Joseph
Hodgson, F.R.S., afterwards President of the College
of Surgeons, who had attended to his injured hand, a
resident pupil at the General Hospital, Birmingham,
where he continued for five years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>
<p>These early years were fruitful in microscopical
observations of both healthy and diseased tissues, and
even in experimental physiology, for Mr. Bowman
was one of those whose advancement in science has
been considerably due to experiments upon animals.
In 1837, after a brief visit to the Dublin medical
schools, he became a student at King’s College,
London, where Robert Bentley Todd had been lately
appointed Professor of Physiology. Mr. Bowman’s
skill and extensive knowledge were soon made use
of by Todd, and he was successively appointed prosector
and demonstrator of anatomy and curator of
the anatomical museum.</p>

<p>In 1838 Mr. Bowman visited the hospitals and
museums of Holland, Germany, and Vienna, and
made a considerable stay in Paris in 1841. Meanwhile
his original studies were bearing fruit in important
papers contributed to the Royal Society, “On
the Minute Structure and Movements of Voluntary
Muscle” (1840), “On the Contraction of Voluntary
Muscle in the Living Body” (1841), and, “On the
Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the
Kidney” (1842). The latter marked a conspicuous
advance in the physiology of the kidney, and Mr.
Bowman was distinguished by receiving a royal
medal for it, having been elected F.R.S. in the
previous year. Professor Michael Foster, in his
address on Physiology to the International Medical
Congress of 1881, referred to these memoirs on muscle
and the kidney as “classic works, known and read of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
all instructed physiologists.”</p>

<p>In 1840 Mr. Bowman, at the early age of twenty-four,
was appointed Assistant-Surgeon to King’s College
Hospital. His scientific writing became much in
demand. He wrote on Surgery in the “Encyclopædia
Metropolitana,” on Muscle, Motion, and Mucous Membrane
in Todd’s “Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology,”
and took a large share with Dr. Todd in writing
and illustrating the “Physiological Anatomy and
Physiology of Man,” which was brought out in parts.
The desire to render this book as far as possible accurate
and original by repeating most of the observations
of others and making new ones where necessary, led
to successive delays in the appearance of the parts.
Finally the closing part was written by Dr. Lionel
Beale, and published in 1856.</p>

<p>Having become a Fellow of the College of Surgeons
in 1844, Mr. Bowman in 1846 joined the staff of the
Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, as
assistant-surgeon, having already made extensive
researches into the minute structure of all the organs
of special sense. His advent to the Moorfields
Hospital was marked by the delivery, in 1847, of
a series of lectures on the “Parts Concerned in
Operations on the Eye,” which were afterwards separately
published. It was evident that ophthalmic
surgery had gained a distinguished recruit. Mr.
Bowman had, independently of Brücke, discovered
the ciliary muscle, and his work brought forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
numerous other facts of structure for the first time.
His paper “On the Structure of the Vitreous Body,”
contributed to the <cite>Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical
Science</cite>, also attracted good attention. His suggestions
on operations for artificial pupil in the <cite>Medical Times
and Gazette</cite> also showed conspicuous capacity for
ophthalmic surgery.</p>

<p>Although much urged to devote himself exclusively
to this branch of practice, Mr. Bowman preferred to
continue in general surgical practice for many years,
attaining the surgeoncy to King’s College Hospital in
1856, two years after he had reached the full surgeoncy
at Moorfields. In 1848 he had been conjoined with
Dr. Todd in the professorship of physiology and
general and morbid anatomy in King’s College, retaining
the professorship, after Dr. Todd’s retirement,
in conjunction with Dr. Beale. But by 1855 Mr.
Bowman found himself so fully occupied that he finally
resigned the professorship. He held the surgeoncy
to King’s College Hospital till 1862.</p>

<p>From this period Mr. Bowman has been the acknowledged
leader of ophthalmic practice. He was
one of the first to employ the ophthalmoscope. His
numerous papers in the Ophthalmic Hospital Reports
and in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions have given
particulars of many improvements in operations on the
eye, which he has adopted, introduced, or improved.
Lachrymal obstructions, glaucoma, conical cornea, and
cataract are among the subjects he has specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
dealt with; and he has by his clinical teaching and
operative example contributed not a little to the
building up of modern ophthalmic surgery. The well-earned
honour of a baronetcy was conferred upon him
in 1884.</p>

<p>The breadth of Sir William Bowman’s sympathies is
shown on the one hand by the active part he took in
the establishment in 1848 of the St. John’s House
Sisterhood for training nurses for hospitals, families,
and the poor, having joined its council from the beginning,
and having materially assisted Miss Florence
Nightingale in her various philanthropic nursing enterprises;
and, on the other hand, by his consistent
advocacy of physiological experiment. He considers
that every step forwards in our knowledge of the
healthy body must lead to a better understanding
of disease and an improvement of our power of
counteracting it, whether in the way of prevention,
alleviation, or cure.</p>

<p>In his address to the British Medical Association at
Chester in 1866,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> this eminent authority took occasion
to protest forcibly against the imputation of cruelty to
animals sometimes made against medical men in respect
of physiological experiments. He insisted both
on the excessive difficulty of these original inquiries
and the high motives which actuate physiologists and
the higher class of scientific inquirers. “There should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>be no doubt,” said he, “as to the free allowance of dissections
of living creatures for the advancement, and
also for the communication, of a knowledge so indispensable
for our race, and for every generation of it.”
He practically charged the opponents of vivisection with
stopping the gates of knowledge, neither going in themselves
nor suffering those that were entering to go in.</p>

<p>The lofty view which Sir William Bowman takes of
the surgeon’s function may be gathered from an extract
from the above-mentioned address. “I see no reason
to doubt that future ages will still accept the pious
saying of one of old, that surgery is the <em>Hands of God</em>;
the Human Hands, apt images and reflex of man’s
whole being, from his morning hour of puling helplessness,
when the</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">“... tender palm is prest</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Against the circle of the breast;”</span><br>
</p>

<p>through all his working day of time, until they shall
be upraised once more at last in joy and adoration, to
hail a brighter and an eternal dawning; the Human
Hands, permitted now, through insight into God’s laws,
to be His instruments of succour to that earthly life
and organisation which His power, wisdom, and love
have first brought into being, still alone both sustain
and cause to perish when their part is played; to that
material organisation which dies every hour it lives,
which indeed dies by living, and lives by dying, and
which wondrously transmits ever its own prerogatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
and dark secrets to a succeeding life, destined apparently
to remain a marvel and a mystery impenetrable
to all generations.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The career of Mr. <span class="smcap">R. Brudenell Carter</span> is of special
interest, owing to the fact that he was a general practitioner
in the country till the age of forty, and came
to London in 1868 without friends or connection, intending
to establish himself as a specialist in eye
diseases, and in a few years attained to eminence.
But Mr. Carter’s life had been previously marked by
energy and success of no common order; and his
literary tastes and accomplishments ranked in the
forefront of the causes of his success.</p>

<p>A reference to Mr. Carter’s ancestry will show that
good hereditary influences met and combined in him.
His father was a major in the royal marines; his grandfather,
rector of Little Wittenham in Berkshire, was a
younger brother of Elizabeth Carter, the well-known
poetess and translator of Epictetus, whose portrait by
Lawrence is in the National Portrait Gallery. The
rector was entirely educated by his learned sister till
he went to Cambridge. The rector’s wife was a granddaughter
of John Wallis, the mathematician and astronomer,
one of the founders of the Royal Society. The
Carters belonged to the younger branch of a family
which had held the manor of St. Columb Major in
Cornwall from the time of Henry VII.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Carter was born, at Little Wittenham on October
2, 1828. After being at private schools he commenced
his professional education by apprenticeship to a general
practitioner, and afterwards entered at the London Hospital.
After becoming a member of the College of
Surgeons in 1851 he practised for a short time at
Leytonstone and at Putney.</p>

<p>At this period Mr. Carter published his first work
“On the Pathology and Treatment of Hysteria” (1853).
This was avowedly based to a considerable extent upon
the opinions and practice of Mr. Stephen Mackenzie,
then recently deceased, who was extensively known by
his successful treatment of the most inveterate hysterical
disorders. This work in itself sufficiently indicated the
presence of a writer possessing both clearness of view
and moderation of statement.</p>

<p>This was followed by a much more extensive treatise
“On the Influence of Education and Training in Preventing
Diseases of the Nervous System” (1855). Mr.
Carter was led to write it by observing the frequent
connection between faulty education and nervous or
mental disorders. It is divided into three parts, dealing
respectively with the Nervous System, Physical Education,
and Moral Education. The latter was that for
the sake of which the book was written; it displays a
thoughtful moderation and breadth of view, without,
however, forecasting the author’s future eminence.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the completion of this book Mr.
Carter started for the Crimea, where he served with the
army as staff-surgeon. Returning home when peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
was concluded, he settled in Nottinghamshire, and soon
moving into the town of Nottingham, took an active
part in the establishment of an eye hospital there. In
1862 he removed to Stroud in Gloucestershire, and
founded an eye hospital in Gloucester. In 1864 Mr.
Carter became Fellow of the College of Surgeons by
examination.</p>

<p>In 1868 Mr. Carter took the important step of removing
to London, resolving to rely upon medical and
other literary work mainly until practice should come.
Thus Mr. Carter has been the writer of very voluminous
contributions to journalism, and has shown great ease
and lucidity of style. In 1869 he was appointed
Surgeon to the Royal South London Ophthalmic Hospital,
and in 1870 Ophthalmic Surgeon to St. George’s
Hospital. He has persevered in commenting severely
upon errors of modern education, and has especially
dealt with evils done in various ways to the eyes in
modern life. One pamphlet of his, “On the Artificial
Production of Stupidity in Schools,” has been often
reprinted. In an address at the opening of the Medical
Session at St. George’s in 1873 Mr. Carter thus spoke
of cramming: “The show pupils, who furnish marvellous
answers to a multiplicity of questions, on a multiplicity
of subjects, in response to the demands of various
preliminary or matriculation examinations, remind me
of nothing so much as of the wooden cannon which
artillerymen call ‘Quakers,’ which require for their
production in unlimited numbers, besides the blocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
of wood, nothing but a turning-lathe and a paint-brush;
and which are mounted, to deceive the enemy, in
embrasures that would otherwise be vacant.... But
our ‘competition wallahs,’ instead of being used to
deceive an enemy, have been used chiefly to deceive
ourselves.”</p>

<p>In 1875 Mr. Carter published an extended and important
“Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Eye.”
In this he distinctly states that in its normal condition
the eye has faults which would condemn a telescope or
microscope to be thrown aside as useless, but which
in the living organ are neutralised by the conditions
under which it is exerted. He recommends any one
who would operate upon the eye to take a great deal of
preliminary trouble, and to train his hands to especial
delicacy of action, so that he shall be indifferent which
he uses. “It has more than once been my lot,” he says,
“to see attempts to operate upon the human eye made
by a surgeon who did not even know how to hold the
instruments he was about to misuse; and I can conceive
few things more painful than such a spectacle.” “In
all ages and countries the bad workman has complained
of his tools, and the good workman has produced the
most varied results by the most simple means. A man
who is very awkward, and whose awkwardness is perpetually
bringing him to grief, hits upon a contrivance
by which he hopes that this natural result may in some
degree be obviated. He calls his contrivance an invention;
and, like those persons of whom it is said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
their glory is in their shame, he is often somewhat
proud of it. Many surgeons of great and deserved
repute have invented each a single instrument, such as
Beer’s knife or Tyrrell’s hook; and some have invented
more than one, chiefly because they have struck out
some new procedure for which new appliances were
indispensable. But as a rule the invention of many
instruments by a surgeon may be accepted as a sufficient
proof of his clumsiness; and when, without valid
reason, any single operator has his peculiar scissors,
and his peculiar hook, and his peculiar forceps, and
his peculiar scoop, all called after his name, it is more
than probable that the gift of fingers has not been
bestowed upon him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter in 1877 gave a course of lectures “on
Defects of Vision which are Remediable by Optical
Appliances,” as Hunterian Professor of Pathology and
Surgery at the College of Surgeons. These were published
in the same year. He has since issued a more
popular work, “Eyesight—Good and Bad: a Treatise
on the Exercise and Preservation of Vision,” 1880.
The following extract has to do with a very injurious
form of prejudice due to ignorance.</p>

<p>“The persons who suffer most from popular prejudice
and ignorance on the subject of spectacles are men of
the superior artisan class, who are engaged on work
which requires good eyesight, and who, at the age of
fifty or sixty, find their power of accomplishing such
work is diminishing. It is a rule in many workshops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
that spectacles are altogether prohibited, the masters
ignorantly supposing them to be evidences of bad
sight; whereas the truth is that they are not evidences
of bad sight at all, but only of the occurrence
of a natural and inevitable change, the effects of which
they entirely obviate, leaving the sight as good for all
purposes as it ever was.” His general interest in
education and its effects is abundantly manifested as
in the description of the late Mr. C. Paget’s half-time
experiment at Ruddington near Nottingham, where
garden work was substituted for about half the ordinary
school hours of a portion of the scholars. The children
so treated were found after a short period altogether
to outstrip in their schoolwork those who devoted, or
were supposed to devote, twice as much time to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter has translated two valuable works bearing
on his specialty: viz., Zander on the Ophthalmoscope,
and Scheffler on Ocular Defects. He has contributed
to “Our Homes, and How to Make them Healthy,” to
the Sydenham Society’s <cite>Biennial Retrospect of Medicine</cite>,
and to many other publications.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Aural surgery has not long been raised to the rank
of an honoured specialty. <span class="smcap">Joseph Toynbee</span> was told
on one occasion by an eminent member of the profession
that he would make nothing of aural surgery.
He replied, “I will work at it for ten years, and then
if nothing can be made of it, I will tell you why.”
On another occasion he said, “I’ll rescue aural surgery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
from the hands of the quacks” (<cite>Medical Times</cite>, July
14, 1866). Prematurely cut off though he was, he
added largely to the scientific knowledge of the ear and
its maladies, and vastly improved their treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Toynbee</span> was born in 1815, at Heckington,
in Lincolnshire, his father having been a large farmer.
After being for some years under a private tutor at
home, he went to King’s Lynn Grammar School. At
seventeen he was apprenticed to Mr. William Wade of
the Westminster General Dispensary, Soho, and studied
anatomy under Mr. Dermott. His assiduous and careful
dissections were of essential benefit in preparing
him for his lifelong minute dissections of the ear in
health and disease. He further studied at St. George’s
and at University College hospitals. Even during his
student life aural studies powerfully attracted him,
and as early as 1836 several letters of his under the
initials J. T. appeared in the <cite>Lancet</cite>. In 1838 he
became a member of the College of Surgeons, and
was selected as assistant-curator of its museum under
Professor Owen. He obtained the Fellowship of the
Royal Society in 1842 for researches demonstrating
the non-vascularity of articular cartilage, the cornea,
crystalline lens, vitreous humour, and epidermoid appendages,
which were published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1841.</p>

<p>Toynbee early entered upon aural practice in Argyll
Place, becoming also one of the surgeons to the St.
James’s and St. George’s Dispensary. He was included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
in the first list of Fellows of the College of Surgeons
on the issue of its new charter. At the Dispensary
he founded a Samaritan Fund for supplying the sick
poor with necessaries of life and warmth. All sanitary
matters were subjects of his profound interest, and he
spent much time in improving the condition of things
in the parishes around him, especially promoting means
of securing adequate ventilation, and the erection of
model lodging-houses near Broad Street, Golden Square.</p>

<p>Toynbee’s practice gradually became very large, but
he continued to dissect, and also to support administratively
as well as pecuniarily many benevolent societies.
He found that so little was really known of the diseases
of the ear from actual dissection, that his only hope of
framing a system of aural surgery was by personal and
persevering examination and record of morbid specimens.
This was carried on for more than twenty
years, until he had dissected about 2000 human ears.
Many of these were derived from his patients in the
large Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, whose condition
he had examined previously to their death. Many
medical men also supplied him with specimens of
diseased ears, as well as notes of cases. He further
inquired closely into the history of very many cases of
patients with diseased ears.</p>

<p>In 1860 Toynbee published an extended work on
“The Diseases of the Ear,” which placed the subject on
a firm basis, and will always remain of great value from
the interesting details of cases and treatment which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
contains. The list of his own published papers on which
it is based, about sixty in number, testifies to Toynbee’s
great industry in research. They include papers on
the structure and functions of the tympanic membrane,
on the muscles which open the Eustachian tube, and
on the mode of conduction of sound from the tympanic
membrane to the labyrinth of the ear, contributed to
the Royal Society, many researches on the diseases of
the ear in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, and a
crowd of series of cases or special memoirs contributed
to the Pathological Society and medical journals. In
1857 he had published a descriptive catalogue of the
preparations illustrating diseases of the ear contained
in his own museum.</p>

<p>On the establishment of St. Mary’s Hospital, Mr.
Toynbee was elected aural surgeon and lecturer on
diseases of the ear; and he published in 1855 and
1856 courses of clinical lectures, which he delivered
there. He took a deep interest in the condition of
idiots, and of the deaf and dumb, and in many cases,
to his great delight, devised plans by which those who
were not totally deaf were taught to speak when their
case had been regarded as hopeless, causing a corresponding
improvement in their mental faculties.</p>

<p>Two of his most zealously pursued hobbies were
ventilation, and the formation of local museums. It
was said that patients who went to him for the benefit
of their hearing, whether they improved in that respect
or not, came away full of the most advanced views on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
ventilation. At Wimbledon, where he took a country-house,
he was indefatigable in developing a village
club, and in forming an educative and recreative
museum. He published valuable “Hints on the Formation
of Local Museums” (1863), as well as “Wimbledon
Museum Notes.” His enthusiastic advocacy was
actively engaged in furthering the establishment of
similar clubs and museums in various parts of the
kingdom. He continued through life an active microscopist
and zoologist, and was elected just before his
death President of the Quekett (Microscopical) Club.
At the same time he was treasurer of the Medical
Benevolent Club, to which he himself largely contributed.</p>

<p>One of Toynbee’s most valuable contributions to the
treatment of deafness was his invention of a method
of forming an artificial tympanic membrane when that
part had been destroyed or perforated. This is fully
described in his pamphlet on the subject, which went
through many editions, as well as in his general treatise.
He first demonstrated the existence of many osseous
and other tumours of the parts of the ear and of the
ossicles of the tympanum, and also the fact that the
Eustachian tube leading from the back of the throat
into the tympanum remains always closed except
during the momentary act of swallowing.</p>

<p>A premature end came to Toynbee’s energetic and
benevolent life. Always active in experimental research,
and much concerned in aural therapeutics, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
experimented on himself with chloroform, and it is
believed, prussic acid vapour, which he wished to cause
to enter by the Eustachian tube into the tympanum for
the relief of tinnitus aurium or noises in the ears. He
unfortunately pursued his experiments while alone,
and was found dead on July 7, 1866, in his consulting
room at Savile Row, with a pad of cotton wool over his
face, and chloroform and prussic acid bottles, his open
watch, and various memoranda of experiments near
him. His death excited universal sympathy for Mr.
Toynbee’s widow and nine children, with whom he
had lived most happily.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If one great aural surgeon became a martyr of
science, another was no less a martyr of philanthropy.
The name of <span class="smcap">James Hinton</span>, which gained wide celebrity
during his lifetime, has been progressively elevated
since his death by the publication of his “Life and
Letters,” by Miss Ellice Hopkins, and of his works on
“The Art of Thinking,” 1879, “Philosophy and Religion,”
1881, and “The Law-Breaker, and the Coming
of the Law,” 1884. Even yet, fortunately, much more
may be hoped for, in the shape more especially of an
autobiography, and of a work on Ethics.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly evident that James Hinton
was, if not a true genius, a man who approached very
nearly to that altitude of nature. As Mr. Shadworth
Hodgson remarks in the introduction to the “Chapters
on the Art of Thinking,” Hinton is a hander-on of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Coleridge’s torch, with less of systematic theology and
more of emotional spiritualism. It is quite impossible
to attempt here to sketch his various philosophical
contributions. Indeed the time has not yet fully
come to estimate them, their influence, or the man
who gave birth to them. As an aural surgeon he
perhaps scarcely rose to Toynbee’s level, but this was
rather because the greatness of his mind and soul in
vaster fields overpowered him, than from defect of
ability. An outline of his life and work only can
here be given.</p>

<p>James Hinton was the third child (of eleven) of the
well-known Baptist minister, John Howard Hinton,
having been born at Reading in 1822. His father’s
mother was aunt to Isaac Taylor, the author of the
“Natural History of Enthusiasm.” It was from his
mother, Eliza Birt, however, that James Hinton derived
most. She is described as a fervent, lofty-souled
woman, full of enthusiasm and compassion, yet dignified
and able to rule others with mild but irresistible
sway.</p>

<p>As a little child, James Hinton, though sweet-tempered,
showed a strong tendency to investigate
everything, and to rearrange the elder children’s games
“as they ought to be.” The father taught the children
to be keenly observant of natural history. The mother
bred them up to have an instinctive feeling for religion,
especially in its aspect of love to God. An elder
brother, Howard, died when James was but twelve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and this bereavement made such an impression upon
him that he soon after was baptized and publicly
received as a member of the Baptist Church.</p>

<p>At school James Hinton did not show special ability,
though he had a remarkable verbal memory until a
certain period, when he suddenly lost it without any
special cause. In 1838 his father left Reading for
London, becoming minister of the Devonshire Square
Chapel. Feeling some pressure of circumstances with
his large family, Mr. Hinton placed James in the first
situation which presented itself, viz., that of cashier
at a wholesale woollen-draper’s shop in Whitechapel.
This temporary immersion in proximity to some of
the coarsest scenes imaginable had a very deep influence
in educing the thoroughgoing altruism which
afterwards characterised him.</p>

<p>After holding the Whitechapel situation about a
year, and spending some time in search of a more
suitable occupation, Hinton became a clerk in an
insurance office in the city. Here, while not becoming
an adept at book-keeping, he sat up at night and gave
himself a miscellaneous education. At this time he
has been described as “an abstract idea untidily expressed;”
he was wholly indifferent to appearances,
and his clothes could never be made to fit him; and
he was often guilty of lapses from politeness. He
was full of argumentativeness, and determined to get
to the bottom of everything.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>
<p>A little later his intense intellectual labours, combined
with the deep sense he now and ever after
entertained of the wrongs to which women were subjected,
brought him into a state of mind in which he
resolved to run away to sea. His intention being discovered,
his father consulted a doctor about him, who
wisely advised that he should enter the medical profession,
as being more fitted to give scope for his
mental powers. He was consequently entered at St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital at the age of twenty. He
was able to perform his entire course of medical study
with very great rapidity, and before taking his diploma
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: went a voyage">went on a voyage</ins> to China and back as surgeon of a
passenger ship. On his return in 1847 be became a
member of the College of Surgeons, and settled for a
time as a surgeon’s assistant at Newport in Essex.</p>

<p>He did not remain here long, but in the autumn of
1847 took the position of surgeon to a shipload of
freed slaves who were to be shipped by voluntary
agreement from Sierra Leone to Jamaica. He remained
for more than a year after this in Jamaica, taking the
practice of a medical man in ill-health, and looking
after the progress of his late charges. In 1849-50 he
travelled homewards by way of New Orleans, where he
gained further insight into the slavery question. In
1850 he entered into partnership with a Mr. Fisher, a
surgeon in general practice in Bartholomew Close; and
became engaged to Miss Margaret Haddon, after an
attachment of ten years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>
<p>In August 1850 we find the first note of his success
in aural surgery; he cured his mother’s deafness by a
syringing properly performed. Some other cases of
success followed this, and were very cheering. Soon
after this he was introduced to Mr. Toynbee, and spent
much time with him both at St. Mary’s Hospital and
privately. Yet he did not find anything in practice
large enough to satisfy his aspirations. “Too many
things crowd upon me; none <em>commands</em> me,” he writes
March 1851. “The thing which shall fill my heart
must be not for myself but for others. To be contented
I must toil not for comfort, nor money, nor for fame,
nor for love, but for truth and righteousness.”</p>

<p>In 1852 Hinton’s marriage with Miss Haddon took
place, one of singularly deep affection. He was now
in practice for himself, finding general practice not
very profitable, especially as he would not condescend
to use arts to obtain success. He continued his study
of aural surgery, and assisted Mr. Toynbee largely in
the classification of his museum, already alluded to.</p>

<p>In 1856 Hinton published his earliest papers on
physiology and ethics in the <cite>Christian Spectator</cite>. In
1858 he contributed an essay to the <cite>Medico-Chirurgical
Review</cite> on “Physical Morphology,” suggesting that
organic growth takes place in the direction of least
resistance—a conception utilised by Mr. Herbert
Spencer in his “First Principles.” In 1859 “Man
and his Dwelling-place” was published and favourably
received. Its success encouraged him to lay aside
practice, reduce his expenses to a minimum, and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
to writing as a profession. He settled in a little house
at Tottenham, where his sitting-room was of such
dimensions that he used to say he could open the door
with one hand, poke the fire with the other, and had
nature given him a third, open the window with it,
without rising from his seat.</p>

<p>At first success attended the venture. Thackeray
accepted for the <cite>Cornhill Magazine</cite> the series of
“Physiological Riddles,” with the remark “Whatever
else this fellow can do, he can write!” These were
afterwards published, with others, under the title “Life
in Nature.” “Thoughts on Health” were also contributed
to the <cite>Cornhill</cite>. But his mind continued in
such activity of growth, ever full, ever changing, that
he had not time to write his thoughts in form for
publication, and he was forced back into practice,
which he had not quite renounced, continuing to see a
few aural patients twice a week at his father’s house.
In 1863 he was appointed aural surgeon to Guy’s
Hospital, and took a house in George Street, Hanover
Square, for the purpose of aural practice. With heroic
and costly resolution, knowing he could not adequately
do his work as an aural surgeon and devote himself to
philosophy, he locked his manuscripts away from his
sight.</p>

<p>Henceforward he rapidly succeeded in practice. In
1866 he took the place vacated by the death of his
valued friend Toynbee, removing to his house in Savile
Row. When in full practice, and not allowing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
to write, his chief life was in conversation. A few
lines may be here quoted from Miss Hopkins’ Life of
Hinton. “It is difficult to give any adequate idea of
the charms of Mr. Hinton’s conversation to a mind at
all in harmony with his own. His most marked peculiarity
was the intensely emotional character of his
intellect. Nature to him was no cold abstraction,
no cunningly contrived machine made up of matter
and force, but a mighty spiritual presence, a living
being, tenderly and passionately beloved. The laws of
nature were to him the habits of a dear and intimate
friend.... But keen as was his delight in purely
intellectual operations, he valued everything chiefly,
if not only, in its relation to the moral.... How often,
from some comparatively remote region of thought, or
of art, would he flash down a light upon some practical
matter, showing perhaps a neglected duty in its vital
relations, or revealing an order in what looked like
moral waste and confusion. Owing to this strong recognition
of the spiritual unity of all life, never was
there a man in whom the barrier between the religious
and the secular was more completely effaced.”</p>

<p>In 1869 his success in aural surgery was so assured,
that an eminent surgeon suggested to Mr. Hinton that
he might justifiably resume his philosophy as an evening
recreation. So after six years’ abstinence he resumed
his writing. But his thoughts, allowed once more
to spring into full activity, were certain to master him.
“Wherever he was, at a friend’s house, in the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
at church, at a concert, he jotted down his notes on
scraps of paper, backs of envelopes, bills, and programmes,
writing them out in full in the evening.”
Finally, these thoughts were printed for his own private
use, and from them a great portion of his posthumous
works is derived.</p>

<p>At last he had made money enough by practice to
retire. His parting gift to his profession was contained in
“The Questions of Aural Surgery,” a work of standard
value; and his “Atlas of Diseases of the Membrana
Tympani.” In March 1874 he retired, but with a constitution
deeply injured by <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: over-work">overwork</ins> and excess of feeling
and thought. His father had died the year before;
his mother died in 1874. He continued incessantly
working, writing, thinking, studying mankind in the
streets and alleys of London, or in the colliers’ cottages
in South Wales, and came to suffer much from sleeplessness.
When he set sail in the autumn of 1875
for the Azores, where Mrs. Hinton had preceded him,
he was already seriously ill. At last he was seized
with inflammation of the brain, and died on December
16, 1875, a martyr to his intense passion for the good
of mankind. Of his intellectual, ethical, and religious
views this is not the place to speak at large; his books
must be left to explain themselves to kindred spirits.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>SIR R. CHRISTISON, SWAINE TAYLOR, AND POISON
DETECTION.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the detection of crimes of poisoning is
but one of the departments of service which the
medical profession is able to render to the law, yet
it is one which has very largely attracted public
attention, owing to the many awful aspects of death
by poisoning, and the helplessness which mankind
has always felt in regard to these crimes. Latterly
the skill displayed in the detection of the existence
of poisons after the death of the victims has set at
rest many of the doubts as to the certainty of judgment
in regard to poisoning, and the discovery of
antidotes to many poisons has supplied a means of
remedy in numerous cases before it is too late. It
is obvious that these results could only begin to be
realised when chemistry had made considerable progress;
and consequently it was not till 1813 that a
young doctor, the celebrated Orfila, published in Paris
the first part of a treatise on Poisons, which was
subsequently merged in his “Legal Medicine,” 1821-3.
The names most conspicuous in founding this new
department of investigation in Great Britain are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> those
which stand at the head of this chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Christison</span>, one of the twin sons of Alexander
Christison, many years Professor of Humanity
in Edinburgh University, was born at Edinburgh in
July 18, 1797. After a complete education, in arts
at the University, he finally chose the medical profession,
and was for two years and a half resident
assistant in the Royal Infirmary. Taking his M.D.
degree in 1819, he spent the next eighteen months
at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, and in Paris,
where he worked in the laboratory of Robiquet at
practical chemistry, and studied toxicology with Orfila
himself.</p>

<p>When Dr. Christison was about to leave Paris, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Dr">Dr.</ins>
Gregory’s death led to a vacancy in the Chair of
Medical Jurisprudence at Edinburgh, and Christison
was proposed to fill it while still absent. It is
significant of the state of knowledge that not one of
the candidates besides Christison had any practical
knowledge of chemistry. The influence of Lord
Melville, however, who had been his father’s resident
pupil when young Christison was born, was the determining
cause of his success in the election.</p>

<p>At first students were very few, not half-a-dozen
attending the earliest course. Christison devoted
himself with characteristic energy to make his chair
a real influence in the university. And here we may
remark briefly on the extraordinary vigour of constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
which the new professor possessed, and
retained almost till death. He could walk, run, or
row better and with more endurance than any man
of his time in Edinburgh, and that is saying a great
deal. He made his new chair his primary object.
Being an extremely neat and clean worker in the
laboratory, his investigations soon became noted, and
it was found, when he was called in to give evidence
on matters of medical jurisprudence, especially in
poisoning cases, that his mind was equally clear and
accurate, and that he could give reasons for his beliefs
which rendered his statements unimpeachable. From
the famous trial of Burke and Hare in 1829 down
to 1866 Dr. Christison appeared as a scientific witness
in almost every case of medico-legal importance in
Scotland, and in many in England.</p>

<p>“As a witness,” says the <cite>Scotsman</cite> (Jan. 28, 1882),
“he was remarkable for a lucid precision of statement,
which left no shadow of doubt in the mind of court,
counsel, or jury as to his views. Another noteworthy
characteristic was the candour and impartiality he
invariably displayed, and which, backed as it was by
the confidence that came of mature deliberation,
rendered him almost impregnable to cross-examination.
This was notably illustrated in the celebrated
Palmer trial. Some of the medical witnesses for the
Crown had got so severely handled by the prisoner’s
counsel that the case seemed in danger of breaking
down, but Christison had not been long in the box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
when the lawyers found they had at last met one
who was a match for the subtlest of them: and so
complete was the failure of all their efforts to discredit
his evidence, that the case, by the time he
finished, had assumed the gravest possible complexion.”</p>

<p>As a persevering experimentalist, Christison was
daring even to rashness in making trials on himself.
He thus tested the taste of arsenious acid, which was
held by Orfila and most others to be rough and acrid,
and which he proved to be rather sweet. He ate an
ounce of the root of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Œnanthe crocata</i>
, which had stood
most poisonous in England and on the Continent; but
the Scotch specimen at any rate did not poison Dr.
Christison. A most striking risk was run in the case
of the Calabar bean. He took a dose before going to
bed, and found its effects resembled those of opium.
Not satisfied, he took a larger dose next morning on
rising, with the result of almost paralysing him. But
he fortunately had a good emetic close at hand, a bowl
of shaving water, and administering a large quantity,
he was partially relieved. But much prostration remained,
and medical assistance had to be summoned.</p>

<p>Christison’s principal services to the literature of
his subject consisted in his work on Poisons, which
was first published in 1829, and went through several
successive editions, and in numerous memoirs and
papers contributed to medical and scientific journals,
some of which detailed improved chemical processes
and tests for poisons, as those on “The Detection <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>of
Minute Quantities of Arsenic in Mixed Fluids,” “On
the Taste of Arsenic, and on its Property of Preserving
the Bodies of Persons who have been Poisoned with it,”
and on the poisonous properties of numerous vegetable
alkaloids.</p>

<p>In 1832 Christison, having raised his class to no
fewer than ninety students, resigned his chair on
appointment to that of Materia Medica, intending to
become, in addition to a clinical teacher of medicine,
an original investigator on the therapeutical action of
remedies. But before he had got fully afloat in this,
practice, for which he had not specially laid himself
out, flowed in upon him, and prevented the realisation
of his desire. He accumulated a fine museum of
materia medica, and his lectures were very popular.
But it cannot be said that he left his mark on medicine
or therapeutics to the same extent that he did on
toxicology.</p>

<p>Christison was eminently a lover of his university,
and exceedingly conscious of its great merits. In
numerous matters he was very conservative, and
strongly resisted some modern views of pneumonia and
fevers. He wielded great influence for many years in
the administration of university matters. In 1838
and in 1846 he was President of the Edinburgh College
of Physicians. From 1868 to 1873 he was President
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1857 to
1873 he occupied a seat at the General Medical
Council. After having been for many years Physician-in-Ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
to the Queen in Scotland, Dr. Christison
received a baronetcy in 1871, on the recommendation
of Mr. Gladstone. In the same year his bust by Brodie
was presented to the university, by general subscription
among the medical profession.</p>

<p>In 1872 Sir Robert Christison completed his fiftieth
year of active service as professor in the university,
the only case of the kind that had ever occurred; and
a large and enthusiastic assembly entertained him at
dinner. Further honours still awaited him; he was in
1875 elected President of the British Medical Association
at its Edinburgh meeting; and in 1876 he was
selected for the Presidency of the British Association,
a distinction which however he declined on the ground
of his advanced age. He soon afterwards retired from
active duty; but lived in considerable vigour till about
Christmas 1881. He died on January 23, 1882, in his
eighty-fifth year.</p>

<p>“As regards his personal characteristics,” says the
<cite>Scotsman</cite>, “Sir Robert was perhaps liable to be somewhat
misunderstood by those who did not know him. Dogmatic
and positive in his opinions, he was inclined to
lay down the law in a way that might not always be
quite agreeable.... On the other hand, friends who had
the good fortune to know him intimately found in his
nature a fund of geniality such as the casual observer
could never have dreamt of. Warmth of heart and
simple unaffected kindness would seem to have been
distinguishing qualities of his private and social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span> demeanour.”
He was a strong Churchman and Tory.
He married in 1827 a Miss Brown, who died in 1849,
leaving three sons.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some years younger than Christison, <span class="smcap">Alfred Swaine
Taylor</span> was contemporary through life with him, and
occupied for many years a quite exceptional position
in the English mind in connection with the detection
of cases of poisoning. He was born at Northfleet in
1806, and educated at Hounslow. At the early age of
sixteen he became the pupil of a surgeon near Maidstone,
and in October 1823 entered as a student at Guy’s and
St. Thomas’s Hospitals, then forming a united medical
school. Later on he was exclusively connected with
Guy’s as pupil and lecturer until his retirement in
1878.</p>

<p>From the year 1826 Taylor gave much attention
to medical jurisprudence, although his diligence was
such as to win for him a prize for anatomy at Guy’s.
Chemistry proved a congenial subject to him under the
instruction of Allen and Aikin, and he was further
stimulated in the same direction by frequent visits to
Paris and all the principal Continental medical schools.
At Paris he heard among others Orfila and Gay-Lussac.
Geology, mineralogy, and physiology likewise engaged
his attention, and so was formed a mind singularly broad
in its views of natural phenomena, and well calculated
to expound their laws. Taylor passed his examinations
at the Apothecaries’ Hall in 1828 and at the College<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
of Surgeons in 1830, and entered upon practice, continuing,
however, to study in the chemical laboratory
of Guy’s Hospital.</p>

<p>In 1831, when the Apothecaries’ Society first required
candidates for their diploma to attend lectures
on Medical Jurisprudence, Mr. Taylor was appointed
to lecture on the subject at Guy’s Hospital, a post
which he continued to hold for forty-seven years. In
the next year he succeeded Mr. Barry as co-lecturer
on chemistry with Mr. Aikin, whose colleague he continued
till 1851, after which he was sole lecturer on
chemistry till 1870, when he resigned this lectureship.
In these important functions Dr. Taylor acquitted himself
admirably. He was exceedingly clear in his statements,
exact and successful in his experiments, while
yet very undemonstrative in manner.</p>

<p>In 1832 the new lecturer commenced his long series
of memoirs bearing on poisoning, by publishing an
account of the Grotto del Cane, near Naples, with
remarks on suffocation by carbonic acid. This appeared
in the <cite>London Medical and Physical Journal</cite>. In subsequent
years he contributed important papers to Guy’s
Hospital Reports, on the action of water on lead, on
poisoning by strychnia, on the tests for arsenic and
antimony, &amp;c., and was soon a recognised authority on
medico-legal questions. He contributed to the <cite>London
Medical and Physical Journal</cite> valuable memoirs on
poisoning, child-murder, &amp;c. In 1836 he published the
first volume of a work on medical jurisprudence which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
was not completed at that time. In 1842 he brought
out his well-known “Manual of Medical Jurisprudence,”
which reached its tenth large English edition in 1879, in
the author’s lifetime, in addition to numerous American
editions. The Swiney Prize of 100 guineas, together
with a valuable silver vase for a work on Jurisprudence,
were also awarded to him.</p>

<p>In 1848, when he became a member of the College
of Physicians, Dr. Taylor published a work on Poisons
which was at once accepted as standard, and has gone
through several editions. In 1865 his large work entitled
“The Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence”
appeared, including much matter for which
there was not space in his manuals. This work attained
its third edition in 1883, having been edited by Dr.
Thomas Stevenson, his distinguished successor at Guy’s
Hospital.</p>

<p>But this represents only a portion of the literary
labours of Dr. Taylor. From 1844 to 1851 he was
the editor of the <cite>London Medical Gazette</cite>, afterwards
incorporated with the <cite>Medical Times</cite>. He largely co-operated
in editing various editions of Pereira’s Materia
Medica. He brought out in conjunction with Professor
Brande a Manual of Chemistry in 1863, and in 1876
edited Dr. Neil Arnott’s celebrated work on Physics.
He was elected in 1853 Fellow of the College of
Physicians, having had previously conferred upon him
the honorary M.D. of St. Andrews University. He
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1845.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
He married in 1834 a Miss Cancellor.</p>

<p>It was as a medical witness in important legal cases
that Dr. Swaine Taylor was most widely known. If
a case of unusual character was before the courts, it
came to be expected that he should be called as a
witness, and for many years he was retained by the
Treasury as their medical adviser on such cases. It
is impossible here to refer to the numerous important
cases of this character in which Dr. Taylor figured.
A writer in the <cite>Medical Times</cite> for June 12 and 19,
1880 (pp. 642, 671), enters into this question from
full knowledge, and describes him thus: “Personally
Taylor was of a tall and imposing figure, gracious to
friends and bitter to foes, and, as the lawyers found,
a superb witness, not to be shaken by any light word
of doctrine.... There was a thoroughness about
Taylor’s work which was always satisfactory.”</p>

<p>In regard to the celebrated Palmer trial, Dr. Taylor
was severely cross-examined, and was contradicted in
important points by experts called for the defence.
In fact, it is possible that the case would have gone
in favour of the prisoner but for the strong confirmation
of the view of the prosecution given by Dr.
Christison, to which we have already referred. Dr.
Taylor expressed his strong views on this question
in an extended pamphlet “On Poisoning by Strychnia,”
most of which appeared in Guy’s Hospital Reports
for 1856. He died on May 27, 1880.</p>

<span class="fs80"><em>PARKES, GUY, SIMON, AND PUBLIC HEALTH.</em></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">“Prevention</span> is better than cure” is the homely
proverb which marks out a large proportion of
the work of sanitary science. The prevention of
disease and of its spread, and the promotion of the
general healthiness of the people—these are objects
which modern progress has brought into view. When
they are completely attained we shall all die of old
age unless cut off by accidents or violence; and this
is a goal which many sanitarians of the present day
have vividly before their mind.</p>

<p>The public health and the public welfare have been
sought by no man more earnestly than by <span class="smcap">Edmund
Alexander Parkes</span>. Of him Dr. Russell Reynolds
said:<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> “In the combination of moral, mental, and
physical beauty, Dr. Parkes was to my knowledge
never equalled, to my belief cannot be surpassed.
Pure as a sunbeam, strong as a man, tender as a
woman, keen as any scientist to unravel the hidden
mysteries of life in its minutest detail of chemical
and physiological research, yet practical in the application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>of his knowledge to the cleansing of a drain or
the lightening of a knapsack; he made the world much
richer by his life, much poorer by his death.”</p>

<p>Parkes was born on March 29, 1819, in the village
of Bloxam, Oxfordshire, his father being Mr. William
Parkes, of the Marble-yard, Warwick, “a man of superior
mind, remarkable alike for industry, firmness, and
nobility of character.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> His mother, Frances Byerly,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Byerly of Etruria, Staffordshire,
was much occupied in literature, and her sister, wife of
Professor A. T. Thomson of University College, London,
was a well-known biographer and novelist.</p>

<p>Under such favouring influences young Parkes grew
up a gentle but unusually merry and happy boy. After
being educated at the Charterhouse, he entered as a
medical student at University College, and spent much
time in his uncle’s laboratory, becoming an excellent
manipulator, and already showing a fondness for
research. At the first M.B. examination at London
University in 1840 he was exhibitioner and medallist
in anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, and medallist in
materia medica. In 1841 at the final M.B. he was
medallist in physiology and comparative anatomy, and
gained honours in medicine. He had taken the College
of Surgeons’ diploma in 1840.</p>

<p>Of this period of Parkes’s life Sir William Jenner,
an intimate fellow-student at University College, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“As a student he was distinguished by brightness and
cheerfulness, amiability, unselfish willingness to help
others at any cost of trouble to himself, energy in
work, diligence in the using of each hour for the
studies of that hour, the high moral tone that pervaded
his converse, and above all, and crowning all, by the
real living purity of his being.”</p>

<p>Early in 1842 Parkes entered the army medical
service, and went as assistant-surgeon to the 84th
regiment to Madras and Moulmein. Here he prosecuted
inquiries which bore fruit in two small publications
on the Dysentery and Hepatitis of India (1846),
and on Asiatic and Algide Cholera (1847). But before
this period he had retired from the army and entered
upon practice in Upper Seymour Street, Portman
Square, becoming further known as a physician by
editing and completing Dr. Thomson’s work on Diseases
of the Skin (1850). This was only a portion of his
literary and original work at this time, during which
he contributed largely to the <cite>Medical Times</cite>, and from
1852 to 1855 edited the <cite>British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical
Review</cite>, for which difficult task he was
exceedingly well fitted.</p>

<p>Having been appointed one of the physicians to
University College Hospital, his influence was very
marked, both on his students and his colleagues. One of
his pupils, afterwards a distinguished physician, said
that he never went round the wards with him without
feeling an intense wish to become better, and at the
same time feeling that he could become so. In 1855<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Parkes delivered the Gulstonian Lectures at the College
of Physicians, taking the subject of Pyrexia, or
the State of Fever.</p>

<p>During the Crimean War, when great pressure existed
upon the hospitals at Scutari, Dr. Parkes was
selected by Government to proceed to the seat of war
to establish an additional large hospital. He fixed
upon Rankioi on the Dardanelles, and his choice
proved excellent. He worked most zealously to make
everything as perfect as possible, and he accomplished
much in spite of the red-tape which was so disastrously
prominent in the war administration of that time. He
did not in any way spare himself, though his constitution
had shown serious signs of weakness in London,
when he had had severe attacks of pneumonia and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: phebitis">phlebitis</ins>. His report on the work of his hospital at
the conclusion of the war was a most valuable one,
and he gained the high esteem of Mr. Sidney Herbert,
afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea.</p>

<p>One result of the Royal Commission of Investigation
into the administration of the war was the foundation
of the Army Medical School, and Mr. Herbert never
showed better judgment than in selecting Dr. Parkes
to be Professor of Military Hygiene in connection with
it. Consequently he gave up in 1860 his post at
University College; he was appointed Emeritus Professor,
and a marble bust of him was placed in the
College museum.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>
<p>Parkes found that in order adequately to teach the
subjects involved in preserving and promoting the
health of the army, he must not only study the special
features of army life and the peculiar liabilities attaching
thereto, but also the general science of hygiene,
then almost new. He organised at the cost of
immense labour a detailed system of instruction, based
on the principle of making the student apply practically
what he taught. All the special questions which
came up relating to air, water, food, temperature,
clothing, house construction, drainage, &amp;c., were as far
as possible illustrated in the laboratory, and individual
instruction was most carefully given.</p>

<p>In 1864 was published the first edition of Parkes’s
“Manual of Practical Hygiene,” a masterly book, accurate,
learned, clear, full, and of the highest interest to the
thoughtful mind. The introduction to this work opens
with a clear definition of the subject. “Hygiene is
the art of preserving health; that is, of obtaining the
most perfect action of body and mind during as long a
period as is consistent with the laws of life. In other
words, it aims at rendering growth more perfect, decay
less rapid, life more vigorous, death more remote.”</p>

<p>Later he says: “It is undoubtedly true that we can,
even now, literally choose between health and disease;
not, perhaps, always individually, for the sins of our
fathers may be visited upon us, or the customs of our
life and the chains of our civilisation and social
customs may gall us, or even our fellow-men may
deny us health, or the knowledge which leads to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> health.
But, as a race, man holds his own destiny, and can
choose between good and evil; and as time unrolls
the scheme of the world, it is not too much to hope
that the choice will be for good.” He further powerfully
indicates the basis of state medicine, to secure
for all individuals the conditions of health which they
often cannot secure for themselves. He shows too
that self-interest, state-benefit, and pecuniary profit
are at one in these matters when rightly understood.
“It is but too commonly forgotten,” he says, “that the
whole nation is interested in the proper treatment of
every one of its members, and in its own interest has
a right to see that the relations between individuals
are not such as in any way to injure the well-being of
the community at large.” It is almost needless to add
that numerous editions of Parkes’s Practical Hygiene
have been called for; it has also been translated into
several foreign languages.</p>

<p>We have enumerated, however, but a small portion
of the subjects upon which Parkes’s unceasing philanthropic
activity was exercised. For many years he
wrote an annual review of the Progress of Hygiene,
contributed to the Army Medical Reports. He served
on many public inquiries relating to matters of health,
and did more for the diminution of mortality in the
army than any other man. He carried on many protracted
and difficult physiological investigations, such
as those on the effects of diet and exercise, on the
elimination of nitrogen, on the effects of alcohol on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the human body, on the effects of coffee, extract of
meat, and alcohol on men marching, chiefly contributed
to the Royal Society. As a member of the
Senate of London University, and of the General
Medical Council, and as Secretary to the Senate of the
Army Medical School, he performed detailed work of
the highest value, and all in spite of delicate health.</p>

<p>“With increase of years,” says Sir William Jenner,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
“his mind ripened, his sphere of action widened, his
influence over others operated in new and perhaps more
important ways; but in all moral and intellectual essentials
Dr. Parkes was as a man what he was as a youth—he
was animated by the same principles and stimulated
by the same faith. As years went on his mind
proved itself to be singularly well balanced; he possessed
an extraordinary power of acquiring information;
his memory was very retentive; he was the best-informed
man in the medical literature of the century I
ever met; he was unprejudiced as he was learned; he
could use with ease the information he acquired, and
could express his ideas clearly and simply; his language
was always elegant, and on occasions eloquent.
His powers of observation, of perception, of reasoning,
and of judgment were all good, and equally good. But
as in his youth, so in his manhood, the beauty of his
moral nature, his unselfish loving-kindness, his power
of inoculating others with his own love of truth,
with his own sense of the necessity of searching for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>the truth, of questioning nature till she yield up the
truth, of earnest work, were his most striking characteristics.”</p>

<p>At last the seeds of weakness which were constitutional
in Parkes developed into acute tuberculosis, and
he died on March 15, 1875, after an illness of four
months. His domestic life had been a very happy
one, but his wife, a Miss Chattock, whom he married
in 1851, had died in 1873, and he was much broken
by her loss. He left no children. His monument is
in the Parkes Museum of Hygiene, which enforces
eloquently the lessons of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">William Augustus Guy</span>, F.R.S., is one of the
most eminent of modern promoters of the public
health. He was born at Chichester in the year 1810,
his ancestors for three generations having been medical
practitioners there. His grandfather, William Guy,
was a pupil of John Hunter, and in Hayley’s life of
Romney it is stated that “Cowper said of him that
he won his heart at first sight, and Romney (who
painted his portrait) declared that he had never examined
any manly features which he would sooner
choose for a model if he had occasion to represent the
compassionate benignity of the Saviour.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>After a childhood spent with this estimable grandfather,
young Guy was educated at Christ’s Hospital,
and later studied for five years at Guy’s Hospital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>Winning the Fothergillian medal of the Medical
Society of London for the best essay on Asthma, in
1831, at the early age of twenty-one, he was encouraged
to enter at Cambridge, where, after a further period of
two years spent at Heidelberg and Paris, he took his
M.B. degree in 1837.</p>

<p>In 1838 Dr. Guy became Professor of Forensic
Medicine in King’s College, London, and later Assistant-Physician
to King’s College Hospital. He early
directed his attention to statistics, and joined the
Statistical Society in 1839, and became one of its
honorary secretaries in 1843. 1844 he contributed
important evidence before the Health of Towns Commission,
on the state of the London printing-offices,
and the consequent development of pulmonary consumption
among printers. He co-operated in founding
the Health of Towns Association, and has been incessantly
occupied in public lectures, investigations,
and writings, in calling attention to questions of sanitary
reform. He has been notably concerned in the
improvement of ventilation, the utilisation of sewage,
the health of bakers and soldiers, hospital mortality,
and many other like subjects. In 1873 he was President
of the Statistical Society, and he has successively
been Croonian, Lumleian, and Harveian Lecturer at
the College of Physicians. His various publications
and papers are too numerous to recount. We may,
however, mention the “Principles of Forensic Medicine,”
and successive editions of Hooper’s “Physicians’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Vade Mecum.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Simon</span>, C.B., F.R.S., is one of the veterans
of the present day in matters of public health, besides
having the highest reputation as a surgeon and pathologist.
Born in 1816, Mr. Simon was a student of
King’s College, London, and was elected a fellow of the
College of Surgeons in 1844. He was appointed in
1847 lecturer on Pathology at St. Thomas’s Hospital.
His subsequent researches and writings, especially
those on Inflammation, have proved his great fitness
for the post. In 1850 he published a very original
course of lectures on General Pathology, as conducive
to the establishment of Rational Principles for the
Diagnosis and Treatment of Disease.</p>

<p>Mr. Simon’s career in connection with public health
began with his being appointed the first Medical Officer
of Health to the City of London. He was before long
selected as medical adviser to the General Board of
Health, and was thence transferred to the important
post of medical officer to the Privy Council. In this
capacity his labours, ably seconded by a crowd of
zealous workers, have been of priceless value to the
nation at large. The successive annual reports published
by the Privy Council sufficiently attest this.</p>

<p>In his first report to the Privy Council, Mr. Simon
stated “that more than half of our annual mortality
results from diseases which prevail with a very great
range of difference in proportion as sanitary circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
are bad or good; that, according to the latest
available evidence, some of these diseases prevail twice
or thrice, some of them ten or twenty times, some of
them even forty or fifty times, as fatally in some
districts as in other districts of England; that the
result of their excessive partial development is to
render the mortality of certain districts from 50 to 100
per cent. higher than the mortality of other districts,
and to raise the death-rate of the whole country 33
per cent. above the death-rate of its healthiest parts.”</p>

<p>In his eleventh report Mr. Simon was able to write
as follows: “It would, I think, be difficult to over-estimate,
in one most important point of view, the
progress which, during the last few years, has been
made in sanitary legislation. The principles now
affirmed in our statute-book are such as, if carried into
full effect, would soon reduce to quite an insignificant
amount our present very large proportions of preventable
disease.... Large powers have been given to
local authorities, and obligation expressly imposed on
them, as regards their respective districts, to suppress
all kinds of nuisance, and to provide all such works
and establishments as the public health primarily
requires; while auxiliary powers have been given for
more or less optional exercise in matters deemed of
less than primary importance to health.... The State
... has interfered between parent and child ...
between employer and employed ... between vendor
and purchaser; has put restrictions on the sale <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>and
purchase of poisons; has prohibited in certain cases
certain commercial supplies of water; and has made
it a public offence to sell adulterated food, or drink,
or medicine, or to offer for sale any meat unfit for
human food.... Its care for the treatment of disease
has not been unconditionally limited to treating at the
public expense such sickness as may accompany destitution;
it has provided that in any sort of epidemic
emergency, organised medical assistance, not peculiarly
for paupers, may be required of local authorities; and in
the same spirit requires that vaccination at the public
cost shall be given gratuitously to every claimant.”</p>

<p>Mr. Simon has been a distinguished surgeon to St.
Thomas’s Hospital, and attained some years ago the
Presidency of the College of Surgeons. He is also a
member of the General Medical Council. In 1878 his
bust in marble was presented to the College of Surgeons
by public subscription, in recognition of his eminent
services in sanitary science.</p>

<p><b>The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,</b>
with a Sketch of Defoe, by <span class="smcap">Henry J. Nicoll</span>.
(Printed from a new font of old-faced type.)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This is a complete, unabridged edition of Defoe’s
masterpiece, with all the 22 beautiful Illustrations from the Drawings
by <span class="smcap">Thomas Stothard</span>, R.A., engraved by <span class="smcap">Charles Heath</span>.
These Illustrations are now printed from the Original Copper Plates,
which were produced at great cost, and are still in perfect condition,
having been steel-faced to preserve them. Copies of the Original Edition
with these same plates, published by Messrs. Cadell and Davis in 1820,
now fetch a high price.</p>



<p>“Mr. Hogg is to be thanked for re-issuing the ‘Life and Adventures of
Robinson <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Crusoe,">Crusoe</ins>,’ with Stothard’s twenty-two designs engraved on
copper by Charles Heath. Their charm is irresistible, and as book
prints they rank among the classics of English art. They are delightful
works. The text before us is complete, and well printed in a clear
type. This edition is, therefore, excellent.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“It was a happy idea of Mr. Hogg to secure the original copper-plates,
and to present his handsome edition of Defoe’s masterpiece with the
most appropriate illustrations that it ever received. The whole of
the twenty-two engravings are given, and we can congratulate the
admirers of the immortal tale, which has been more truthfully and
tenderly illustrated by Stothard than by any other
artist.”—<i>Queen.</i></p>

<p>“This is truly an <i>edition de luxe</i> of Defoe’s masterpiece. It is
beautifully printed and enriched with twenty-two full-page engravings
from the drawings of Thomas Stothard, R.A., and altogether is a book
to please the eye and delight the heart of all who have ‘a weak <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: side">side</ins>’
to our sterling old British classics.”—<i>North British Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>“An admirable edition of the immortal ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ adorned with
engravings from Stothard’s celebrated designs, forming a sumptuous
present.”—<i>Truth.</i></p>

<p>“The plates come out in this edition with the sharpness of their
earliest days, and are full of force and grace. Those who get this
copy of Defoe’s great work will indeed have a
pleasure.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“A book which many would desire to have on their shelves in common with
other English classics. Small editions are numerous enough, but Mr.
John Hogg now supplies us with a handsome library volume, which,
moreover, has the advantage of Stothard’s exquisite designs engraved by
Heath. The volume, a full-size 8vo., finely printed with wide margins,
has a critical introduction by Henry J. Nicoll.”—<i>Bookseller.</i></p>

<p>“An edition printed in fine bold type, and containing reproductions of
Stothard’s well-known illustrations. And, what is more, it contains not
only the ‘Adventures’ but also the ‘Further Adventures’ of Robinson
Crusoe, which are often omitted from popular editions.”—<i>St.
James’s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“This is one of the handsomest editions of Defoe’s immortal work which
we have seen an <i>edition de luxe</i>, indeed. It is a trite, but in
this case a perfectly fitting statement, that Mr. Hogg has spared no
expense in the production of what is at once a beautiful gift-book,
and an equally beautiful volume for the drawing-room
table.”—<i>Manchester Weekly Post.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Editions de luxe</i> of standard works being in constant demand,
Mr. Hogg has done well to add to the list this handsome edition of
Defoe’s masterpiece. Stothard’s designs, it need scarcely be said,
are greatly superior to the ordinary run of book engravings, being
admirable alike as illustrations and on account of their intrinsic
merits. Altogether the book may be confidently recommended to those
who desire to possess a library edition of a work which seems likely
to maintain its proud pre-eminence, and it would not be easy to find
a work better adapted in all respects for presentation
purposes.”—<i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i></p>

<p>“Everybody may not be aware of this latest and most beautiful edition
of the adventures of the old York mariner. We may say then, without
qualification, that this volume is one of the most elegant that has
come out of the press this season. The sketch of Defoe is very
well done.”—<i>Yorkshire Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“Few of the many reprints of works of acknowledged excellence that have
been recently published will surpass the one now under notice in
intrinsic worth.”—<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p class="center">“<b>A most attractive general cookery-book.</b>”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tenth edition, small crown 8vo., 392 pp., cloth, price 3s. 6d.</i></p>


<div class="blockquot-cat">
<p><b>Dainty Dishes. Receipts collected by</b>
<span class="smcap">Lady Harriet St. Clair</span> (late Countess Münster).</p>
</div>

<p>“In spite of the number of cookery-books in existence, Lady Harriet St.
Clair’s volume is well worth buying, especially by that class of
persons who, though their incomes are small, enjoy out-of-the way
and <i>recherché</i> delicacies.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“It is true to its title, but shows that ‘dishes’ may be ‘dainty’
without being costly or elaborate, with nothing but wholesome
ingredients to begin with, and delicate management
in the cooking.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“It is a capital cookery-book. All the recipes are clear and well
conveyed, and they will enable anyone who chooses to follow them
to produce capital cookery.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“The contents of the volume are varied, much attention being bestowed
on Scotch dishes, and it is something to say in this age of many
cookery-books, that the recipes given are not fanciful, but practical.
They can really be cooked, a recommendation that cannot be given
to many of our cookery-books.”—<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“We can warmly commend this excellent manual. Mr. Nicoll is a fair and
sensible critic himself, and knows how to use with skill and judgment
the opinions of other critics. His book has many competitors to contend
with, but will be found to hold its own with the best of
them.”—<i>St. James’s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Nicoll’s facts are commendably accurate, and his style is
perfectly devoid of pretentiousness, tawdriness, and mannerism, for
which relief in the present day an author always deserves much thanks
from his critics.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Nicoll has performed his task with great tact, much literary skill,
and with great critical insight. No better book could be put into the
hands of one who wishes to know something of our great writers, but who
has not time to read their works himself; and no better guide to the
man of leisure who desires to know the best works of our best writers
and to study these in a thorough manner. Mr. Nicoll’s literary
estimates are judicious, wise, and just in an eminent
degree.”—<i>Edinburgh Daily Review.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Nicoll’s well-arranged volume will be of service to the student
and interesting to the general reader. Biography and history are
combined with criticism, so that the men are seen as well as their
works.... The copious and careful table of chronology gives a distinct
value to the book as a work of reference. The volume is without
pretension, and deserves praise for simplicity of purpose, as well as
for careful workmanship.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>To the Editor of the <i>Parlour Menagerie</i>.</p>

<p>“The early love of Nature, especially as manifested
by the Habits and Instincts of Animals to which you
refer, in your own case, is so common to a healthy
boy’s nature, that the <i>Parlour Menagerie</i>, a work so singularly
full of interesting examples culled from so wide a range of Zoology,
and so fully and beautifully illustrated cannot fail to be a favourite
with the rising generation—and many succeeding ones—of Juvenile
Naturalists. When I recall the ‘Description of 300 Animals’ (including
the Cockatrice and all Pliny’s monsters) which fed my early appetite
for Natural History, I can congratulate my grandchildren on being
provided with so much more wholesome food through your persevering and
discriminating labours.—<span class="smcap">Richard Owen.</span>”</p>

<p class="center">From the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">John Bright</span>, M.P.</p>

<p class="center">To the Editor, <i>Parlour Menagerie</i>.</p>

<p>“I doubt not the <i>Parlour Menagerie</i> will prove very interesting,
as indeed it has already been found to be by those of my family who
have read it. I hope one <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: o">of</ins> the effects of our better public education
will be to create among our population a more humane disposition
towards what we call the inferior animals. Much may be done by
impressing on the minds of children the duty of kindness in their
treatment of animals, and I hope this will not be neglected by the
teachers of our schools.... I feel sure what you have done will bear
good fruit.—<span class="smcap">John Bright.</span>”</p>

<p>“The <i>Parlour Menagerie</i> is well named. Full as an egg of
information and most agreeable reading and engravings, where before was
there such a menagerie?”—<i>Animal World.</i></p>

<p>“We have never seen a better collection of anecdotes and descriptions
of animals than this, and it has the great advantage of numerous and
admirable woodcuts. Pictorial illustrations form an important and
valuable addition to any such collection. Those in the book before us
are of remarkable excellence.... We highly commend the spirit which
pervades the book, a spirit intensely alien to cruelty of every kind.
On the whole, it is one of the very best of its kind, and we warrant
both its usefulness and acceptability.”—<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p class="center">“Mens sana in corpore sano.”</p>

<p>“We like the thorough way in which Mr. Adams deals with ‘Self-Culture:
Moral, Mental, and Physical.’ His chapter on the courtesies of home
life, and the true relation between parent and child, is specially
valuable nowadays. He certainly answers the question, ‘Is life worth
living?’ in a most triumphant affirmative.”—<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>“Books for young men are constantly appearing—some of them genuine,
earnest, and useful, and many of them mere products of the art of
book-making. We have pleasure in saying that this volume by Mr. Adams
deserves to take its place among the best of the first-mentioned class.
It is fresh, interesting, varied, and, above all, full of common sense,
manliness, and right principle.”—<i>Inverness Courier.</i></p>

<p>“Young men who wish to make something of themselves should invest seven
sixpences in this most valuable volume.”—<i>Sword and Trowel.</i></p>

<p>“Books prepared for girls are too often so weak and twaddly as to be an
insult to the intellect of girlhood. This new work is an
exception.”—<i>Daily Review</i> (<i>Edinburgh</i>).</p>

<p>“Worthy of a somewhat longer analysis than we shall be able to give
it.... Parents will be benefited by its perusal as well as their
daughters ... the more so that it is not written in a dry homiletic
style, but with a living kindness and sympathy.”—<i>Queen.</i></p>

<p>“A long list of books is given both for study and amusement. This
list is selected with care and without prejudice, and should prove a
great assistance to girls in doubt what to read.... It is a sensible
and well-written book, full of information and wholesome thoughts for
and about girls.”—<i>St. James’s Budget.</i></p>

good, his style clear, and his treatment so impartial that his work has

prove the catholicity of a most instructive and valuable
work.”—<i>Peterborough Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“The work shows very plainly that much care and judgment has been used
in its compilation.... The intrinsic worth of its contents and their
lasting usefulness admirably adapt it for a present. The eight
engravings have been chosen so as to give examples of the highest
samples of sacred art.”—<i>Oxford Times.</i></p>

<p>“A very delightful volume for Sunday reading, the devotional character
of the hymns giving an especial charm to the work. The historical
information will be proved full of interest to young Churchmen, and
young ladies especially will find the work to be one well adapted to
inform the mind and gladden the heart.”—<i>Bible Christian Magazine.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Grant’s volume is worthy of high praise, alike for its careful
research and its discriminative quotations. There is so much religious
literature which is below the level of criticism, that we cannot but
welcome a volume which commends itself to a cultivated Christian

for from it a very lucid account may be obtained of many of those
momentous occurrences which have served to swell the history of
England, and to afford an example to succeeding
generations.”—<i>Bazaar.</i></p>

is at all events presented a vast mass of information in an attractive

no curtailment of the “Further Adventures.”</i></p>

<p>“A complete, unabridged edition of ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ in which something
of the old tone, which has been to a great extent sacrificed in modern
versions of this boy’s classic, has been revived. Twelve of the quaint
illustrations by Thomas Stothard, engraved by Heath, are given, and are

eyes of its young readers at all events, find a higher recommendation in
the fact that the ‘Further Adventures’ have not been subject to their
usual curtailment. A short biographical sketch of Defoe and Bernard
Barton’s ‘Memorial’ of Robinson Crusoe are given by way of introduction,
and add appreciably to the value of the edition. The book is excellently
printed and bound.”—<i>Nottingham Daily Guardian.</i></p>

properly styled a ‘complete edition.’ A portrait and brief Memoir of
Defoe precedes his tale.”—<i>Manchester Weekly Post.</i></p>

contains twelve illustrations by Thomas Stothard, R.A., which are all
good, and a portrait of Daniel Defoe, with a well written sketch of

men.”—<i>School Board Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Hope is one of the best of living writers of boys’ books, and we
do not think we over-estimate the merits of the book before us if we
say it is one of his best. The idea is a happy one.... The result is
altogether as successful as the idea is happy.”—<i>Birmingham Daily
Post.</i></p>

<p>“Good, wholesome, stirring reading for boys of all ages. The scenes of
these adventures are laid in every quarter of the globe, and they
include every variety of peril.”—<i>World.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Ascott Hope has hit upon a really excellent idea in his ‘Stories
of Young Adventurers,’ and carried it out with admirable success....
It would be difficult to pick out a better book of its kind; young
readers will hang over every page with an absorbing interest, and all
the time will be imbibing some useful historical information. We should
like to think that so thoroughly good a book will be in the hands of a
great many boyish readers.”—<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“Sure to make the eyes of our boys gleam.... The tone is healthy and
robust, and for its kind the book is one of the best we
know.”—<i>Sword and Trowel.</i></p>

<p>“A debt of gratitude is due to Mr. Hope.... The work is as good as
the design.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

circumstances, in peace or in war, at school or at work, at home or out

<p>“Mr. Hope is a scholar, and his wide knowledge and culture give his
books a <i>cache</i> of their own.”—<i>Journal of Education.</i></p>

<p>“We like Mr. Hope’s stories. They are fresh and healthy and vigorous.
They can inspire no evil thought; they must encourage to good efforts;
they are never dull; they are always amusing. A volume of stories of
which this can be truthfully said needs no further
commendation.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“If we must choose one story as being particularly good, it will be
‘Victor’s Pony.’ It is very clever and dramatic.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“There is an old saying, that we must not tell tales out of school,
but no schoolboy will quarrel with Mr. Ascott Hope for having broken
the rule.”—<i>Literary Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“No school library can be complete while Mr. Ascott Hope’s books are
not in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: circulation">circulation</ins>.”—<i>Derbyshire Mercury.</i></p>

<p>“The nine stories which make up this volume, without being of the
too-goody sort, have one and all an instructive tendency which does not
in the least diminish the interest both boys and girls will take in
perusing them. Though these tales are more especially written for boys,
not a few girls would read them with unmixed pleasure.”—<i>British Mail.</i></p>

<p>“Excellent samples of what this ready writer can achieve. Not a story
in this collection of nine drags or ends tediously. This is just the
book for boys.”—<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Hope thoroughly understands what kind of stories boys want, and
what will please them. The various stories recounted in this new volume
are all related in Mr. Hope’s inimitable way.”—<i>Nonconformist.</i></p>

<p>“The popularity of the fairy tales of Hans Andersen can never wane,
and new editions of some of them can scarcely fail to be successful.
Here is one published by Mr. John Hogg, with a very readable
biographical sketch of the author by Dr. Kenneth Mackenzie (the
original English edition of Andersen’s ‘In Sweden’), and a variety of
illustrations, including a portrait.”—<i>St. James’s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“A volume which will be popular with young people. The stories are well
selected, and there are some excellent illustrations in the
book.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“This beautifully illustrated edition of Andersen’s exquisite stories
is sure to be a favourite with all young people who become its
fortunate possessors. The biographical sketch is admirably
written.”—<i>Sheffield Independent.</i></p>

<p>“We recommend all boys and girls who have not read about the wonderful
Shoes of Fortune, and the Ugly Duckling and the Snow Queen, to get this
book as soon as possible.”—<i>Literary Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“The tales, of course, we need not criticise; but we may say that the
illustrations are not unworthy of them. They show something of the same
graceful fancy which guided Andersen’s pen. Of the singular personality
of Andersen himself we get a really valuable sketch. Dr. Mackenzie
estimates him justly, we think, but not unkindly.”—<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

respect of virtues, such as perseverance, method, and punctuality,

whether for making money or, which is much more important, for
formation of character. With regard to the latter object, there is no
question of substantial reward to the student, and we therefore wish
the book success.”—<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“There is encouragement for others in its anecdotes, and its advice is
dictated by morality and common-sense. To carry out its maxims might
not ensure the making of a fortune during the present times of depression,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
